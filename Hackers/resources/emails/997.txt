                             VILLAGE KIDS
Pockets of learning heirloom quality toys, books, and gifts!  14K gold 
lockets… can you think of a more treasured keepsake?  Doll clothes and
accessories to fit 18” dolls, including American Girl Dolls, plus a
growing group of items in the $7 range our kids say are “Way cool!”:
Practical but fun shampoos, etc, with your own Sea Critter suspended 
in them (remove the collectible mermaids and friends when the bath
products are used up!), and a selection of Sculpey craft kits, tools, 
and books (baked Sculpey creations are permanent and waterproof!)
More soon!  Village Kids just keep growing.
