For the past four years, I have struggled to produce Black and White in Exile, the new landmark 
television documentary series on the dramatic experiences of Cubans and Haitians in America and their 
impact on host communities. The series begins airing on PBS in April (Check Local Listings Below).  We are 
beginning to see the rewards. The Miami Herald has hailed it as Extraordinary, Ground breaking and 
Heart wrenching. The series features music by Joan Baez, Celia Cruz, Paquito D'Rivera, Farah Juste, 
Rara Machine, Beny Moré, Olatunji and many more.

But the battle rages on.  We now need viewers like you to watch Black and White in Exile and let your 
stations know what you think. We are happy to inform you that the following progressive stations are 
airing the series:

April 1		Waco, TX			KCTF-TV	
April 2		New York, NY		WLIW-TV/21	
April 2		Muncie, IN		WIPB-TV

Immediately after you view Black and White in Exile, please be sure to become a member of these 
leading stations.  We would like to hear your comments too! And if your city is not on the list, please call us 
at (908) 769-3250 and we will let you know when your station schedules the series. Unfortunately, some 
public television programmers do not believe that Americans like you are interested in programs like Black 
and White in Exile. Some programmers didn't even screen the series to determine its quality! They simply 
refused to take the PBS feed! If you as an American want to see Black and White in Exile on your local 
public television station, call your local PBS station and remind them that it is  Viewers like YOU that fund 
public television!  A fact some in public television  seem to forget. 

Thank you for your kind attention.
