Subject: AD: Accept Credit Cards - NO LEASE!

If you are a business owner, and need to accept credit cards for payment,
the banks don't want you to see this!

ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS RISK FREE 
RENT - NO LEASE or PURCHASE REQUIRED!

Have you been considering taking credit cards for your business but
don't want the anxiety of getting locked into a lease or saddled
with expensive equipment??  

Now there is an alternative:  RENT for $29.00 a month! 

    There's no contract. It's month by month. Cancel anytime.
    The equipment is guaranteed.   
    Home-based, internet-based and small businesses are welcome.   
    TEST IT OUT with no risk.   
    NEVER SIGN A 48 MONTH LEASE!   

We are the ONLY COMPANY in the USA that offers benefits like these:  

    * For less than ONE DOLLAR a day, you can accept credit cards.
Cancel at any time. No  ridiculous 48 month lease. No hassles 
getting approved. Rent, not lease!  

    * Doesn't matter how large or small your business is, 
nor how long  you've been in business.  

    * Approval takes ONE WEEK. Why? We hand walk the application 
through each step of the bank's process. Eliminates the standard three
to six weeks other banks take. No lost sales. 
 
    * Very low rates. If the card is swiped it is 1.79% plus $.20 per charge.
If it's non-swiped (i.e. mail-order or phone order) it's 2.5% plus $.30 each
transaction. Excellent rates- please compare.The monthly statement is $10.00. 
We guarantee we can beat anybody elses' rates. Period.  

   * $75 application fee (100% refundable if you are not approved for ANY reason.)  

You can look all over the internet, but you will never find another company
RENTING the software, or one that requires NO DEPOSIT!
