YOUR PHONE RINGS...
Even before you pick it up, your PC displays the name of the caller.
It's your Uncle Bob. Bob's contact log and notes appear on-screen.
(His daughter's 10th birthday is next month and her pet turtle is
named Oscar -- It's in your notes.) Bob tells you that he'll be in
town next month and he wants to have dinner with you. You enter the
date into your calendar and set a reminder alarm for two days in
advance (so you don't forget to bring a birthday gift for his
daughter). Sounds like a pretty advanced and expensive communications
system doesn't it? Well, it might be advanced, but it's not out of
reach.

THE BEST-SELLING ORGANIZER OF ALL TIME
Caller ID enabling is just one of the many advanced features packed
into the #1 best-selling organizer of all time -- Sidekick. With
full-featured calendars, flexible contact files, and powerful
communications capabilities, Sidekick 98 lets you manage all of your
activities with ease. It includes TrueSync, so you can share
information with hand-held devices like the PalmPilot.
