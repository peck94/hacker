are on board.

Products: At the moment we have a state-of-the-art nutritional line which
includes a product that some people choose to replace Prozac and Valium.
Also, a weight management product, a longevity formula and, an 7-day
stop smoking system.  We also have an European skin-care line with the

Compensation plan: Our company uses an unilevel compensation plan.
The total payout is 60% wholesale.  We can make it to the top and max
out the plan with only two strong legs. Unlike other unilevel plans which
promote width, ours promotes depth while you can also go as wide as
you wish.  There's  also the fast-start bonus and coded bonus from
product starter packs, not from trainings.  Leadership bonus for the
full-time serious networkers. Our compensation features an unblockable

Timing: Our company just started pre-launch but the whole program is
fully operational.  Meaning, the company ships products and marketing
materials, pays commissions on time, etc.  Currently there are only about
1000 distributors are involved.  It's the first time in network marketing
history that a company has everything in place before signing of its first
distributor.  Nationwide cable TV infomercial will start in May.  All leads
