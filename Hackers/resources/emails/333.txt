American Justice, once only blind, in now both deaf and dumb as well. (PHILLIPS/1986)

"I'm out here trying to screw a taxpayer..." Senior IRS Agent Bobbie Jack Tadlock

"Screwing taxpayers is Congressional intent." United States Supreme Court

If your elected really wanted you to vote they would include your ballot in the annual tax return
you are forced to fill out.

I WONDER…

WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN HITLER ORDERING THE GAS TURNED ON AND IRS OPERATIVES COERCING PRIVATE CITIZENS INTO TURNING ON THE GAS WITH THE
 UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT
CHEERING THEM ON?

I WONDER…

What chance does one have against such authority when the sharp choices of democracy
are subordinated to the conveniences of bureaucratic harmony?

I WONDER…

When this happens, are you like one of the members of the United States Congress 
United States  Judiciary, or the United States Justice Department, and the President, 
and elect  to look the other way?

I WONDER…

Why we preach we are a democracy when in actuality we practice official terrorism.

I WONDER...

Why American media is programmed to the beat of political and judicial rhetoric.

I WONDER…

Why you won't have time to read about things that matter written by someone who dearly cares
about protecting civil liberties.

TRUE STORY:
	A white-haired feeble 87 year old widow lived in a cozy little house that her late husband, an iron worker, had left her.  Not remembering that she had Social Security benefits she paid some major medical bills out of money that her late husband had jammed into gallon jugs.  Taxes had been paid on all of the funds in the years of earning.  One spring day this petite widow was playing with a couple of her grandchildren when two ladies approached her.  They identified themselves politely as United States Internal Revenue Agents.  Being a gentle old sole she invited them in.  They asked her how she came across the money to pay her medical bills.  She told them the truth.  They went away and she went on playing with her grandchildren.  A month later a grissly man knocked harshly on the old widow's door and handed her a notice of federal tax deficiency for $700,000.00 and some odd change.  The old widow didn't know what the notice was and just stuffed it away with other things she felt were not important.  Three months later, absent notice of any sort, a knock came to this medically infirmed old widow's door.  A burly man handed her a notice of sale to satisfy the $700,000 plus penalties added, tax lien.  A few days later a tax lien sale was held.  When someone told the feeble white-haired 87 year old widow what was happening as she stood on her front lawn where just days ago she had been playing with her grandchildren, she instantly died of a heart attack.  The sale was stopped.  The paramedics were summoned.  They unceremoniously carted the old widow's body away to the morgue.  Then the sale continued. A few months later the grandmother's children took the IRS to task.  What was discovered was that the money that paid for medicals had been declared by her late husband and no taxes were owed whatsoever.  It was all a mistake.  When the agent in charge was asked why he instituted such an action, he replied, "My superiors ordered me to do so."  No apologies.  Nothing.  No money or house was ever returned to her heirs.  It happened in Utah.  Welcome to America!!!

As you, the citizen of America, continue to read,  you will discover that American Justice, once only blind, is now both deaf and dumb as well.

I WONDER…

Why Ken Starr insists that no one is above the law when daily in every American courtroom where oaths are taken witnesses perjure themselves while Judges cheer them on: 
only the chosen few are ever prosecuted: 
when politics rises to the occasion.

I WONDER…

Why the Supreme Court of the United States relies on its backbone defense
 "in the interests of national security"
to provide security for its Justices and Judges, and then elects to injure the highest elected Office in this nation by permitting that Office to be compromised by an insane bureaucratic standard:
"Presidential security must be subordinated to political witch hunts".

I WONDER…

Why one can go to prison for filing or failing to file their United States federal income tax return.

I WONDER…

 Why the United States Tax Code is intentionally designed to make liars out of all of us.

I WONDER…

Why a nation that professes fairness for all manufactures a Tax Code that intentionally defies interpretation by any person of reasonable intelligence and makes perjurers (liars) out of all its filers. 

I WONDER…

Why your member of Congress is unsatisfied with your tax contributions and why they insist you pay more than your fair share  through lawless asset forfeiture.   

I WONDER…

Why most people are unconcerned until their keys slip through their fingers.

I WONDER…

Why every United States Judge is above the highest law of the land - this nation's Constitution.  Each took a solemn oath to uphold this holiest set of laws of our land yet they violate it daily with their  "one eye on the deficit approach to jurisprudence when it comes to tax cases" decisions.  
That includes Ken Starr, a Judge, who states that no one is above the law.

I WONDER…

Why appointed United States Supreme Court Justices and other Federal Judge appointees are accountable to no one while the voice of the We, the People, of the United States of America, our President, is accountable to everyone.

I WONDER…

Why certain United States media are out to smear the President of the United States of America.

I WONDER…

Why more than $45,000,000.00 of our tax dollars can be allocated for a witch hunt to destroy the Presidency of the United States of America while nothing is budgeted to care, retrain, and feed this nation's helpless and homeless.

I WONDER…

Why politicians are looking to raise taxes by $500,000,000.00 annually against those who can 
ill afford to pay.  And what do they really plan on doing with the funds?

I WONDER…

Why the citizens of America don't understand that  for every gallon of gasoline they purchase 
they pay .76 in "sin" taxes.

I WONDER…

Why no  IRS employee has ever been tried for violating 26USCS7214 when daily many IRS employees criminally violate this United States Code Section.

I WONDER…

Why one is forced to file an income tax return under penalties of perjury yet no one is forced to vote.

I WONDER…

Why politicians don't want the majority of Americans to vote.

I WONDER...
	
Why voting ballots don't accompany annual tax returns.


I WONDER…

Why every private citizen in America is a target, not a taxpayer.

I WONDER…

Why the newly announced "neo-nazi" mission statement (1998) of the Internal Revenue Bureau is to collect revenues not taxes.

I WONDER…

Why America hasn't abandoned its menacing Tax Code whose venom trickles down the lifeblood of an unsuspecting American society.  Its grace imparts no less silent economic death upon the innocent as well as the intentful thief who steals from all.

I WONDER…

Why OFFICIAL TERRORISM is not policy…it is the law in America.

I WONDER…

Why the United States Supreme Court ruled that Congress does not intend to compensate victims of Official Terrorism.

I WONDER…

Why the Supreme Court ruled it is far better for the private citizen to suffer losses at the hands of Official Terrorists than to have the coffers of the United States pay for its employees criminal wrongs.

I WONDER…

Why America's Courts and Congress permit Official Terrorists to silence all voices of reason by financial strangulation.

I WONDER…

Why countless tragic victims of Official Terrorism are no longer living to tell their stories in front of  "window dressing" politically motivated media hearings.

I WONDER…

Why one is free to speak so long as  one's speech supports the Official Terrorist policies dictated by United States  Courts and Congress.

I WONDER…

Why the major news networks parrot each other and fail to focus on Official Terrorism in America.

I WONDER…

Why American national media is of an Enquirer mentality driven by stockholder greed rather than being truthful as evidenced by the Panamanian "Sneak Attack".

I WONDER…

Why NBC-TV anchor Tom Brokaw when questioned why he was telling the American public lies about what really happened in Panama, stated, "It is not up to me to determine the truthfulness of a story.  I am paid to read what my News Director puts on the scroll before me."

I WONDER…

Why  we massacred more than 10,000 unarmed sleeping men, women, and children during the 1989 Panamanian "sneak attack".

I WONDER…

Why there is little difference between America's government and any other communist government.

I WONDER…

Why each private citizen is spied on by the World's number one Spy Government using social security numbers to track every movement of its citizens, from cradle to grave, and that Congress cheers these actions on.

I WONDER…

Why certain bureaucrats under color of federal authority have been held absolutely immune from common law crimes such as slander, libel, attempted kidnapping, civil rights violations and conspiring to murder law-abiding, God-fearing, private citizens by the United States Supreme Court.

I WONDER…

Why laws are unequally applied based on America's "subject to" doctrine - "subject to" who you are.

I WONDER…

Why uncontrolled police brutality is considered by American Courts and Congress to be an ordinary and necessary method to control the populace.

I WONDER…

Why bureaucrats acting under color of federal authority are out to screw the private citizen with lawless liens and levys while their superiors,  the Courts and Congress and the President cheer them on.

I WONDER…

Why the United States Supreme Court has ruled that Congress did not intend to preserve the core values of the equal protection of the law  clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I WONDER…

Why when one is lethally harmed by bureaucrats acting under color of federal authority the United States Supreme Court ruled a private citizen is not deprived of due process of the law as long as the citizen is "entitled" to  a 'post-deprivation' hearing - a  hearing that never materializes.  Can you just imagine as part of your last rites or while lying in your grave the Pastor saying this is a post deprivation hearing and it is not intended to be the delivery of the eulogy?

I WONDER…

Why post-deprivation no long legally implies one has been denied?

I WONDER…

Why the United States Supreme Court has ruled that whenever it is convenient, the fifty States do not have to follow Federal law in administering their laws.

I WONDER…

Why Americans tolerate a "double jeopardy" standard: where one can be found not guilty of criminal charges and then be tried again for civil charges in another court - for the same alleged crime - in total violation of The Constitution of the United States of America.

I WONDER…

Why it is the intent of its Congress, its Courts its President and its bureaucracy to "screw" taxpayers out of life, liberty, and property absent due process of the law.

I WONDER…

Why bureaucratic and judicial insanity rules in America.

I WONDER…

Why "Congress never intended to preserve the core values specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment," PHILLIPS v US/STATE OF CALIFORNIA, 3/98 - SEMINOLE v US, 1996.

I WONDER…

Why "Congress never intended for victims of Official Terrorism to be compensated," majority decision  the United States Supreme Court.


I WONDER…

Why Justice is not only blind, but deaf and dumb as well and your elected would rather look the other way as the Germans did, while you, your family, friends and neighbors become 
targets of official terrorists.

I WONDER…

Would you rather look the other way?

I WONDER….

Why America's youth act the way it does: could it be that America is absent integrity in its courtrooms.

"The Supreme Court takes a one eye on the deficit approach to jurisprudence when it comes to tax cases.  Tax cases are sons 'o bitches," Associate United States Supreme Court Justice, Lewis Powell.

"We don't care how wrong the United States is we (bureaucrats) are here to protect her (against the people of the United States of America)." Charles Fried, Solicitor General, United States of America.

"Why did your client sue us, doesn't he know we are a Cast of Millions?" Chief Counsel, United States Department of Justice,  Office of Professional Responsibility, Michael E. Shaheen, Jr, (PHILLIPS v. US).

"I'm out here trying to screw a taxpayer. Senior United States IRS Agent, Bobbie Jack Tadlock, in Supreme Court documents.  (PHILLIPS v US).

"In a long or short hearing you will not be able to show that the government can in no way prevail. Case dismissed." (PHILLIPS v. US).


The purpose of this email is for you to identify defects of the United States Judicial establishment and its and Congressional failure to provide justice, which are closely connected.  A reluctance for Congress to indiscriminately review vital issues is quite natural but also most dangerous, for it leaves unexamined fatal defects of structure and system that still endure as United States Courts continue to justify their every inconsistency while the United States Justice Department  silences every voice of reason opposed to official terrorist tactics - as stated - "We are here to protect the United States.  We don't care how wrong she is."  What chance does one have against such authority?
The injustice suffered by anyone who has fallen prey to the whims of Official Terrorists, the custodians of the United States Internal Revenue Code, will find no relief in knowing that they are not alone, as they cry out, "That could never happen to me!" as that unforgiving knock comes to their door as innocently they open, pleading, "It's not fair!" as the agent of their lament turns to them and says, "Maybe not, but it's the law." Quickly you will discover, as did former United States Senator Howard Baker, among other survivors, that American Justice, once only blind, is now both deaf and dumb as well. 
How does one reform the doctrine of Official Terrorism, in the light of the savagery of the system, remains the great mystery.  The answer is to be found in the old joke about the person who was looking for their house key one night, not on the doorstep, where it had slipped from their hands, but across the way under a streetlamp - because, as explained, it was much too difficult to find a small key in the dark.  In the matter of Official Terrorism, you too, have been looking hard and long on the wrong side of the street.
What is the significance of Official Terrorism? 
To those of you worldwide who do not understand the implications, examples follow:
Taxpayer was anti-union.  A union official bribed a tax official to put lawless liens and levys on Taxpayer's thriving business and personal fortune.  The tax official did just that and admitted after taxpayer was totally ruined in Supreme Court documents that the intent was to lawlessly put taxpayer out of business for life.  The Supreme Court in this case ruled it is better for the taxpayer to suffer than the Treasury pay out for the crimes of its employees. Under the Taxpayers Bill of Rights Act 1988 which this writer originally authored 3/1983 token compensation can now be won by victims.  Congress agreed with the Courts by limiting damages against the United States.  California taxpayer could not relieve himself of erroneous and lawless liens and levies by bankruptcy today in State Court due to the Supreme Court's SEMINOLE decision. 
The terrifying SEMINOLE v. U.S., 1996, is a vastly more treasonous decision.  These Supreme Terrorists now state that a State does not have to adhere to Federal Law in tax cases and that the United States Congress is not empowered to pass a law to require States to follow Federal Law in tax or bankruptcy matters.  The implication:  Any State in the Union can assess an erroneous or lawless tax on any individual, from defective IRS computers or by a vendetta and it is up to that individual, as is the case with PHILLIPS, under PHILLIPS v. US/STATE OF CALIFORNIA and SEMINOLE to prove that that tax is incorrect. Any illegal tax so assessed cannot by PHILLIPS or SEMINOLE be discharged through bankruptcy absent the State's consent.   Absent assets (i.e.,Court filing fees and legal fees) to address a Court of competent jurisdiction, a taxpayer has absolutely no chance against such authority: there is no adequate remedy at law.	
If you just happen to be an individual of average means, and some State's computer screws up by picking up erroneous federal tax information from IRS computers (which is supposed to be unlawful to begin with), there is "no adequate remedy at law" for you if the State doesn't voluntarily remove the lawless assessment.  Even if you are so lucky to have the funds to exhaust State Court remedies and move on to the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court's announced, "one eye on the deficit approach to jurisprudence when it comes to tax cases," will leave you penniless for life- as they will refuse to hear your case.  
American Courts are presently sinister, diabolical, and absent credibility when addressing tax and other sensitive matters.  Justices and Judges are greater criminals than those they judge as they took an oath to uphold the law of the land, the Constitution of the United States of America - which daily they ignore - under color of some disguised authority.  They are above the law.
America is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  America is, in reality, a government of the government, by the government, and for the government.
The time has come to put a screeching halt to the village "one eye on the deficit approach to jurisprudence" insanity. Let's impeach all those who have forwarded and continue to forward this dangerous doctrine.  If you, like our President,  members of  Congress, and our Courts, don't give a hoot about resolving the problem of riding this nation of  "official terrorism" and care to look the other way, when your turn comes - look elsewhere for assistance.
As of March 28, 1998 there are only 118 members of the House of Representatives and a mere handful of United States Senators that want to rid this nation of Official Terrorism by discarding our present terrifying Code that no person of reasonable intelligence can interpret.  Neither the President nor Vice-President share the view of the 118.  Two proposals for sweeping reform exist that make sense.  The National Sales Tax and the Flat Tax.  The real difference between the two: the National Sales Tax would eliminate our "Spy Government" and give one peace of mind at tax and fee paying time whereas the Flat Tax would not.  The Flat Tax encourages "Spy Government" and continues the complexity of filling out and filing forms that defy interpretation by any person of reasonable intelligence at taxpaying time. 
This is an election year, We, the People, can do something about our elected who "would rather look the other way" as their constituents become prime targets of  "official terrorists".
My fellow Americans, We, the People, would like to invite you to become a supporter of Citizens Against Official Terrorism, a national advocacy group working to rid the United States of Official Terrorism through legislation.  This is not a new brand of terrorism.  It is authorized by you by your silence, the President of the United States of America,  each member of  the Congress of the United States and each and every Judge seated on the bench of our United States Courts.  The  folks elected or appointed to protect We, the People, don't give a damn about protecting anything but their special interests, even though thousands have died at the hands of  "official terrorists".  
Once this nation's political media's eyes closed to the nationally televised Senate window dressing hearings to correct the United States Internal Revenue Service's  organized "official terrorism" program,  this nation's elected and her bureaucracy went back to "business as usual" adding more scalps to their "official terrorist" teepee - which indicates just how political this nation's media really are. 
	The doors to American Justice are certain to remain shackled shut as long as you, your members of Congress, United States Courts, and the President of the United States of America  permit Official Terrorists to deal in their drugged 'behind closed doors' whispering discretion.  No known remedy presently exists to cure the Cartel of Official Terrorists addiction to shepherding their terrifying self-endowed powers.  America's President, Congress,  and its Courts,  will continue to silence any voice of reasonable intelligence's  inquiry with programmed statements such as "in the interests of national defense" to justify their every inconsistency when questioned about what they are going to do about Official Terrorism. We, the People, are soon destine to be bound by a new brand of bondage which eventually will become institutionalized, driving all God-fearing, freedom-loving, tax-paying Americans, into its deep pits of slavery. 
It took Congress 90 days to pass a law to prohibit inmates from receiving witness fees after the Supreme Court ruled it was Constitutional yet it has been more than 12 years since the Supreme Court ruled that Official Terrorism was Congressional Intent. Congressional indifference to Official Terrorism has left many a God-fearing, law-abiding, tax-paying,  United States citizen's dead body in its wake.  The question is: How much longer do you believe We, the People, of the United States of America, are going to continue to tolerate Official Terrorism - before we strike back?  
 
	Please excuse the intrusion.  In order to safeguard the promises our forefathers left us it is sometimes inevitable that attention to sensitive issues be delivered by unusual means - to more than 40,000,000 homes worldwide - as knowledge is the core to correction and, correction, it sometimes comes at great cost, yet, in the end, it will be, inevitable.

Should you be opposed to terrorist government ruling your life and would like to help change the way America's  Courts and Congress support official terrorism as a way of American life, we would like to hear from you. Your voice will make a difference!  Any donations to assist in the costs of correcting the cancer of Official Terrorism will be appreciated.
