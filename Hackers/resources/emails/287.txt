Hello, I would like to tell you about an auction site on the Net
that I am currently using and very happy with. Its a new site and the
server speed is great. Also, you can upload an image to the site very
easily and can cross-post an item into two categories. (I love that
feature) There are many items in hundreds of categories for sale. I've
included the link for your convenience.

       Have a look!  =)
