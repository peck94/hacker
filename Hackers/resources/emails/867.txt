Hi:

Can you find information on the Internet faster than in your own office?  Do you waste precious time shuffling through 
papers?  Do you lose files?  Is your desk a mess?



Would you like to be able to find ANYTHING in your office in less than 5 seconds...GUARANTEED?



The computer has given everyone the capability to generate more information than ever, and managing it is increasingly 
complex.  Ironically, the one thing in the office that technology has not changed is how we file and retrieve paper, until 
now.

The Paper Tiger is powerful software combined with a proven system for filing and retrieving paper (also works great for CDs, 
diskettes, videos, really anything).  The software allows you to find information in your office or home FAST!
