 "Catapult Your Business To The "Summit Of Success"
   In 30 Days Or Less Using Our Proprietary Email
   Marketing Strategy!"

 
 "Have you ever wanted to use Email Marketing
  to dramatically increase your business, but
  chose not to because of the controversy of
  so called "Spam?"

 
 ***Confessions Of An Email Marketer!***

 Dear Friend,

 I started out in marketing several years ago
using all the basics of Internet advertising:
Search Engines, classifieds, newsgroups...ect.

 I had some success in the beginning. But I 
never reached the level of success that everyone
said that Internet advertising would bring.

 I was constantly trying new things in hopes of
discovering something that could generate 
immediate cash flow for my business! 

 "I needed a Breakthrough!"

 Then one day a friend of mine suggested using
something called "Bulk Email" to advertise
my business. He said that it was fast,cheap
and could generate immediate results!

 So to make a long story short I bought
a piece of bulk email software, loaded up
a million email addresses I received free
of charge and blasted out my sales letter!

 I could here the money rolling in as I
nervously waited by the phone for the orders!

 And you'll never guess how much I made. Are you
ready for this?

 Absolutely nothing......!

 It was a complete bomb!  An utter failure!


 
 I later discovered what was going wrong.
It wasn't the mailing that didn't work, it
was the method that I was using that failed.

 To shorten the story even more, for 2 years
I became a literal madman in search for the
perfect method of using Direct Email to
generate cash for myself.

 I would constantly try new things, testing
the results. If it made money I kept it. If
it didn't I tossed it. Plain and simple....

 I discovered little known things such as:

 * 12 words when used in any combination
   would increase response by 112%!

 * The 3 things that MUST be in your marketing
   before anyone will buy from you!

 * Where to find truly Targeted email list
   that has generated over a $1000 a day for
   our business! (That's a real figure folks)
 
 * What products sell best over the Internet
   and what products are a total "Flop"!

 * Why over 80% of MLM'ers fail on the Internet!

our proven system of Email Marketing.
