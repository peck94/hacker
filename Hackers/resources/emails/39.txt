Subject: Hey Check This Out     Cheap Stuff!!!!!!




    How would you like to buy a late model car, truck, or van 
for $1,000 to  $2,000? Would you jump at the chance to buy 
a big screen TV for $150 ? Maybe a $750 VHS Camcorder for 
$ 90 ? Or a large fishing boat for under $1,500 ? I will 
bet you never heard of any one buying a house for under 
$ 5,000 It's happened , and it will happen again. 
    Bargains like these, incredible bargains, are waiting for
buyers like you.  At auctions held every day. Across the nation. 
In every state. It's the best thing the government has ever done 
for us. Nearly every level of government from city and town on 
up through county, state and federal, is in possession 
of excess property that must be disposed of.
