Over $400 billion dollars is owed to the North American Public!

Yes we know the subject sounds crazy but it really is true!

Think about this for just one brief moment. What has
happened to all the money that was owned by individuals
who died without a will?  Where has all their money gone?

Did you know that over 60% of North Americans die
without a will!!!

Did you know that over 85% of all the people who
built the railroads in the USA never claimed their
pensions?

BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE NEVER BEEN
CLAIMED BY ITSRIGHTFUL OWNERS!  THESE ARE JUST TWO
EXAMPLES OF LOST MONEY!THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WAYS
THAT MONEY BECOMES LOST!

Forwarded mailing addresses expire after one year when
you move.  Each year millions of utility refund checks,
final paychecks, dividends etc, never reach therightful
owners because the forwarding addresses expire!

Where has all the lost money gone from the time the
United States became a nation?  It is just sitting
in depositories - and it can be reclaimed with ease!

You owe ot to yourself to check out our website.  If
nothing else you will be amazed by all the ways money
is lost and how much money there is.

You know, American Express is sitting on over $3.6
billion in uncashed travellers checks alone! You have
got to check our websitet.

The average adult in North America is acutally owed,
and get this, on average - OVER $1000!

If you are curious at all check out our website at 
http://www.leadgeneration.net/funds - chances are, you
are owed some money!
