**********************************************************************

I was just reading Earl Nightingale's book on the 6 simple words
that can change a person's life.  I wanted to share this with you.

The message I want to share with you is:  Ever wonder why some
people make six figure incomes, while others who work just as hard
make almost minimum wage?!?

The fact is that the way people make money really looks like a
pyramid.  Those that make the 6 figures do not do ordinary things.
They use their own efforts, and they make it happen using unique
skills that the people at the bottom of the pyramid do not use.
The people at the top sell unique or high priced items, and 
they make a lot of money.

On the other hand, the people at the bottom of the pyramid work
typical 9-5 jobs, and they do everyday, ordinary tasks that do
not require much talent or expertise.  These are the people who
do NOT make the money.  They think like everyone else, and they
consequently get the results that everyone else gets.

Now I am aware that you probably are working a home based business
right now, which means that you have left the bottom of the pyramid
and are climbing to the top.  THAT'S WONDERFUL!  You are the pioneers
for the future millionaires in America.  

Did you know that the statistics say that out of 250 million people,
880,000 of them are Millionaires?  So the odds of you being a one of
those 880,000 are roughly 1:250 - You can do it!

Now where do I come in?  I work a venture where I help people make
$2000 - $5000 per week without multi-level marketing.  I also show
people how to reduce their tax liability by up to 95%. 

I don't sell, nor do I push my product. The challenge I am facing
right now is that I am overwhelmed with Leads. I would like to find
just a few quality people to work with who have the desire to make
six figure results so that I can help them get started. 
Again, I do not do any selling or convincing, and neither will you.

If you would like more information, you can reply by email subject IFEA.

I want to share the wealth.  I know how much money is out there,
and I believe we ALL DESERVE to have a share, as long as we don't
quit.  I want to wish all of you the best in whatever venture you are 
doing, and I'll see you at the top.

Sincerely,

Bonnie
