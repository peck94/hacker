Subject: Network Marketing Is NOT a Get-Rich-Quick Scam

There are, however, some network marketing companies that are . . .
get-rich-quick scams, that is.  Others, like Amway and NuSkin and
Herbalife and Mary Kay, have been around for years and have provided
lucrative incomes for thousands of people who were willing to work very
hard for a few years so they could do whatever they pleased for the rest
of their years.  That's what we're doing and that's what we're offering
you.

We decided to start a network marketing business when we learned that one
of the most successful and respected people in the industry was president
of a new network marketing company.  We're both in our 50's and facing the
very real possibility of NEVER being able to retire.  We had nothing saved,
no pension and knew we couldn't trust the social security system.  We also
knew that only 3% of the people who "try" network marketing actually
succeed.  Experience had taught us that the word "try" was a cop-out!
You either commit to giving it your all or you don't bother.  We gave it
our all and we're already half-retired.  (Bill quit his retail job just
two weeks ago and Erika will be closing her accounting business at the end
of this year.)  Our grandaughter just loves having her Pops around when
she's here on weekends.

Are you willing to at least learn the details of how we can help you
achieve personal and financial freedom just like we're doing?  If you
are, just send an email to 

     mailto:kimmy9@infback.com

with "Send Info" in the Subject line.  We'll get right back to you with
all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Whatever you decide to do, may your life always be filled with enough
time to spend with those you love the most.

Bill and Erika
