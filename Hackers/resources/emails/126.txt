Subject: 16-M Clean E-mail Addresses
Message-ID: <>

16 Million Clean E-Mail Addresses

We took a total of over 92 million e-mail addresses from many 
of the touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some
were $300+)! We added the millions we had in storage to those.
When we combined them all, we had in excess of 100+ million 
addresses in one huge file.

We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this 
huge list. It cut the file down to less than 25 million!! 

Can you believe that!?  It seems that most people that
are selling CD's are duping the public by putting numerous 
files of addresses in the CD over and over. This created
many duplicate addresses. They also had many "program
generated" e-mail addresses like CompuServe, MCI,
ANON's, etc... This causes a tremendous amount of
undeliverables, and for those that use Stealth programs, 
clogs up servers quickly with trash. etc...

We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to 
remove addresses with vulgarity, profanity, sex-related 
names, postmaster, webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, 
etc...Also we  eliminated all .edu, .mil., org., gov., etc...
After that list was run against the remaining list, it
reduced it down to near 16 million addresses!

So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of 
dollars buying all others that are out there on  CD. Using
ours will be like using the 100+ million that we started with, 
but a lot less money and a lot less time!

We  also purchased Cyber Promo's ($995.00) CD. We 
received it just prior to finishing  production work on the 
new CD. We had our people take a random sample of 
300,000 addresses from the touted 2.9 million that they 
advertised. We used a program that allows us to take a
random sample of addresses from any list. We were able
to have the program take every 9th address, thus giving 
us a 300,000 list of Cyber's e-mail addresses from top to
bottom. We did not clean these, but we did create 3 
separate files named cyber1.txt, cyber2.txt, and cyber3.txt
of 100,000 addresses each. This will give all people that
use the list an opportunity to send mail to the list before 
deciding if their CD is all it's hyped up to be.

We also included a 2+ million "Remove/Flamer" file 
broke into separate files for ease of extracting and adding
to your own database of removes.
