Hi,

What's in it for you? 

************************************

You can stick it in the ground near your ball
convenient but out of the way.  It eliminates 
all of those little frustrating problems that 
have plagued golfers for years: 
Slow play, wet grips, and lost clubs.  
But best of all you won't shank it rotten
when you use the ClubCaddie!

Curious? Hey you have got to check out the Club Caddie at: 
http://www.clubcaddie.com 

*************************************

It's so simple and so obvious we can't 
believe someone didn't think about it before us.

*************************************

PS.
Special offer: the first 100 buyers will receive a free 
sleeve of Tittlest golf balls with their 
purchase of the Club Caddie!
