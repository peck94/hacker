</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>
Hello!

I am an ordinary person...just like yourself.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" 
e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was 
this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time. About two months ago 
I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  
Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to 
invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! 
I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O. box 
has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin 
and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box! I am stunned by all the cash  
that keeps rolling in!

My wife and I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past three years, and are sick of bringing home just enough cash to pay off our bills and still be able to support a family.  With all this extra money we've generated in the past couple of months, I can gladly say we are now debt free and able to finally take that honeymoon vacation to Maui, HA!!  I strongly urge you to give this program a chance, you wont believe your eyes when the money starts arriving at your FRONT DOOR!!!!!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually 
set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will 
make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the 
computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the 
money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take 
the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can do this, so can you!

GO FOR IT NOW!


The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3><B>OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to 
produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the U.S. allows 
you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports 
costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:

  <FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3>* $5.00 cash
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they
     ordered.
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>
To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT! The 
$5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 

<FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3><B>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>

<FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3>******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you
don't order them).
     
     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose name appears on 
the list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!
  
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the
        four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save
        them on your computer and resell them.

     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four
        reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
        for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them
        from you.

2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
     next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other
     than is instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose
     out on the majority of your profits.  Once you  understand the way
     this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it.
     Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will
     not work. ( I talked to a friend last month who has also done this
     program.  He said he had tried "playing" with it to change the
     results.  Bad idea.... he never got as much money as he did with
     the un-altered version.  Remember, it's a proven method!

    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and remove 
      the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has made it through 
      cycle and is no doubt counting their 50 grand!

    c.  Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to  REPORT #4.  

    d.  Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.

    e.  Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

    f.  Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and
     save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction
     portion of this letter.
  
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
     INTERNET!  Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive,
     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  
     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
     report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY
     SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send 
     out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't 
     advertise until they receive the report!

<FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3><B>HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal 
is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on 
the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this
example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with
$5............................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100).....................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)............$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
                      THIS TOTALS        ----------->$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 
people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford$20). 
You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE! 

REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and 
purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

<FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3><B>******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>

 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and
     follow the directions accurately.

 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them
    when the orders start coming in because:

        When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report 
to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or 
Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state  that "a product or service must be exchanged 
for money received."

 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
    instructions exactly, your results WILL be SUCCESSFUL!

 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


<FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3><B>******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at 
least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching 
which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, 
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit 
to the income you will generate from this business!

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule 
of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose 
a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity 
to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to 
participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial 
security.   Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS

     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When 
I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail." I made fun 
of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages 
involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the 
old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  
Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had 
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured 
and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   
I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not 
for me. We owe it all to MLM.
           Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any 
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked with 
the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money 
in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined 
just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with 
money still coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial 
investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough 
orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my 
medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded 
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year 
than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with 
a faster return.
         Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so 
I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...
I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will 
soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way 
on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!
