Not sure if anyone else on the Net told you, but there's a Web site giving away a $5,000.00 stainless steel gas grill. (Ever see a $5,000.00 grill before?)

You don't have to buy anything, either.  Just register at their Web
site--http://ironworks-gasgrills.com

Cool site, by the way, with some really nice looking grills and stuff.
Check it out.

Hey- if you win the grill, how about an invitation to lunch next summer?
