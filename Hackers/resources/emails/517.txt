Dear All,

   I just received this  mail from a friend of mine  in my College.  Please
respond to it. It will just mean  employing a  little bit of time and
won'tcost you a penny. All it  needs is  the heart for  you to  send this mail.
PLEASE pass this  mail on to everybody you  know.  It is the request of a
little girl who will soon leave this world as she has been a victim of the
terrible disease called CANCER. Thank  you for your effort, this isn't a
chain letter, but a choice for all of us to save a little girl that's dying
of a serious and fatal form of cancer.  Please send this to everyone you
know...or don't know. This little girl has 6 months left to live, and as
her dying wish, she wanted to send a chain letter telling everyone to live
their life to fullest, since she never will.  She'll never make it to prom,
graduate from high school, or get married and have a family of her own.=20
By you sending this to as many people as possible, you can give her and her
family a little hope, because  with every name that this is sent to, The
American Cancer  Society will donate 3 cents per name to her treatment and
recovery plan.  One guy sent this to 500 people!!!! So, I know that we can
send it to at least 5 or 6.  Come on you guys.... and if  you're too
selfish to take 10-15 minutes scrolling this and forwarding it to
EVERYONE,
then you are one sick person. Just think it  could  be you one day. It's
not even  your money ,just your time!!!

PLEASE PASS ON
ASHEESH
