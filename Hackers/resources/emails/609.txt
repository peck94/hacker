</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>This is not some impossible to do, fly-by-night scheme. Quite the contrary. I've studied most of those programs you've seen advertised everywhere. And I'm making the techniques they teach work in spite of the half truths they tell you. I've taken the b.s. out and condensed those 6 or 10 tape programs costing up to $350 into 3 simple, easy to understand reports:<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>I started studying various courses, seminars and books on the subject in 1982. I just didn't have the nerve to try them and was afraid to fail...so I just didn't try. However, in 1993, I again ordered another course and was determined to at least try the techniques this time. They make it sound soooo easy. At the time,  I was working a regular 8-5 job for a decent wageand I certainly didn't have a pile of money to get started  with. I had another 15 years to<BR>
I studied the course tapes and written materials every night until 2 am. I just wouldn't stop. I then started to work. I quickly found out that all isn't as stated in those courses. Some of the stuff indeed works as the authors state but some just doesn't. I found out the hard way. But after a year of trial and error, I found the way. That's why I've written these three reports. To take the mystery out of it for you.  <BR>
<BR>
Below, I briefly describe what I've done since then and how I did it. All the details are in the reports. I use them everyday and they work.<BR>
 <BR>
<U>Property1</U>: A large wood frame dwelling in the "Historic Garden District" in New Orleans. I took possession in May, 1994, two months after I bought the residence I live in now, for very little down, less than a $1,000.  I bought the house, over 4000 square feet and registered as a historic landmark, for </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><U>1,000.</U> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>out of my pocket and assumed a "non-assumable" mortgage <U>without the lender even knowing<BR>
<U>Property 2</U>: I took possession of this one in October 1994. I bought it from two ladies who wanted to retire and move on.  I bought it for about 10,000 below value and with only </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><U>$800 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></U>out of my pocket. NO QUALIFYING!! NO LOAN APPLICATION!! AND VERY LITTLE MONEY!!  I collect $750 per month rent now.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Property 3: </U> This was my first "cash out" property. It was also my first attempt at renovation. It is a four plex in an Old New Orleans neighborhood. I bought it with </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12>ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY DOWN, BORROWED THE MONEY TO PURCHASE AND RENOVATE, AND THEN PUT </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12>OVER $12000.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>in the bank after the repairs were paid for. AGAIN....NOT A PENNY DOWN AND NO LOAN APPLICATION!! <U>N0THING!! </U> I now collect over $1200 per month rent.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Property 4:</U> A tri-plex in another very nice New Orleans area. It was abandoned and overgrown with weeds and vines.  I took possession in Nov. 1995. I borrowed the money to both purchase and to do about $30,000 in repairs. I put about </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><U>$1800 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></B></U> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>of my money into it. I did qualify for this one. I have about 50,000 in equity in it now. I get $1400 per month rent for i <BR>
<U>Property 5:</U> Took possession in July 1997. I bought it, with about $3000 of my money, had major surgery, hired some contractors to change the kitchen, paint the interior and redo the floors while I was laid up and sold it 10 weeks later. I put a check for </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><U>$73,500. profit</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></U> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>in the bank after the sale. Not bad for being on my back, disabled!! <BR>

My friends, I can't force you to believe that all the above is the truth but it is and can be documented to the letter...and there are others I acquired similarly. If I hadn't at least tried 5 years ago, where would I be now?? I have deals working right now..today, that will allow me to put around 100K in the bank by the end of 1998.  All of the properties will be paid for by the time I am 50 years old. Now, I don't have to work anymore and could sell them all by the end of the year and buy a yacht and s<BR>
