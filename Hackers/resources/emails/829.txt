I'm pleased to announce one of the greatest products of the 90's!

AS SEEN ON TV!

Fat Absorb
"The diet sensation of the 90's"


You've tried all kinds of diets and exercises but haven't succeeded. Now you can 
lose weight with no change in diet or exercise - with no effort at all.

FatAbsorb absorbs up to 12 times its weight in fat like a magnet and is all natural. 
It is a fat scavenger that searches out fats.


YOU CAN BE ON A NEW ROAD TO HEALTH!


What is FatAbsorb?

Fat Absorb is a fat scavenger in the digestive track. Fat Absorb is magnetically 
attracted to fat, especially to saturated fat, and binds it making it indigestible.

"Fat Absorb is the all-natural, affordable way to lose weight while enjoying the foods 
you love. When you take a few Fat Absorb capsules before each meal, a portion of 
the fat grams you consume bind together and pass out of the body naturally. You 
will reduce your fat intake, which will give your body no choice but to burn your 
existing stored fat.
