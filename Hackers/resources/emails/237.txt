$10 to a FORTUNE!!!

THIS IS BETTER THAN THE LOTTERY, CHAIN LETTERS, GAMBLING, MLM OR ANY OTHER MONEY MAKING PROGRAM

its honest, legal, ethical, highly profitable and ... very affordable!!

We are offering you a simple, fast track method to true wealth, with the freedom to live debt free and have the money to make your dreams come true!!! Money to buy anything you want.

EARN IMMEDIATE & RESIDUAL INCOME NOW!!

Here is how the program works

1) we will send you $10.00 for everyone that you personally sponsor who joins our program, regardless of where they are placed in your matrix/ These payments will be mailed to you at the end of each week.  When you have sponsored 5 people, we will pay your way into Phase 1 of the Phase IV Program at no additional cost to you.  THe Phase IV Program that we are sponsoring, will open the door to your financial freedom.  All you have to do is to make at least 5 sales and you are on the way...

PHASE IV uses a 5 x 2 matrix to achieve your finacial goals
	5 people on level 1
	25 people on level 2
  total 30 people for a full matrix

Phase I pays $500.00 when your matrix is complete PLUS a FREE re-entry into Phase I and a FREE entry into Phase II

Phase II pays $4,000 plus a FREE re-entry into Phase II and FREE entry into Phase III

Phase III pays $50,000 plus a FREE re-entry into Phase III and FREE entry into Phase IV

Phase IV pays $500,000 plus a FREE re-entry in to Phase IV

Every time you compete a matrix in each Phase you start a new matrix in Phase I, which pushes you progressively through each Phase.  So in effect,  1 matrix of 30 people pays $500
	 2 matrix of 30 people pays $4,000
	 3 matrix of 30 people pays $50,000
 	 4 matrix of 30 people pays $500,000

And this continues to repeat itself as long as you keep promoting the program

THe COST is only $20 one time to register
Nothing else comes close to the potential income of the PHASE IV Program!!!
TO register and to get complete details: Send a $20.00 bill along with 5 loose First Class Stamps to

When you have sponsored 5 people we will send you their names & addresses, so that you can help them complete your & their matrixs, in order to push you through the various phases of the Phase IV program. As quickly as possible.
All Payments for the Phase IV program are mailed on completion of each matrix
