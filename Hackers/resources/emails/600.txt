FREE DEMO OF SOFTWARE THAT SUBMITS YOUR SITE TO 900 SEARCH ENGINES!
 
I thought I would drop you a line today to let you know about the revolutionary new "Search Engine Spider" which will allow you to submit your web page to 900 different search engines
and directories, in the categories YOU CHOOSE! 
 
I have a FREE DEMO DOWNLOAD OR CD of the software waiting here for you. If you decide you like it because it's SAVING YOU TONS OF TIME and GETTING YOU TO THE TOP OF THE SEARCH ENGINES, then register and pay only $49.95!
 
How can you go wrong?  You get to try it first for free, and only pay if you want to unlock all of its features.  Think about how much you paid for your last "submission service" to run just once!  You can run this over and over to KEEP YOUR RANK ON THE SEARCH ENGINES!
 
All you have to do to get your FREE DOWNLOAD is visit:
 
http://www.mastermirror.com/
 
Just for stopping by, you will have access to our HUGE LIST of FREE CLASSIFIED ADS!
  
Thanks again for your time.  I look forward to hearing from you.


Best Regards,

Amy Horowitz
