Hello,

Your email address is on an "opt-in" list
of people who don't mind receiving
commercial email advertisements.  If 
this is incorrect, please see the removal
instructions below.

Unsolicited Commercial Email is a HOT topic
on the internet.  Starting in January 1999,
you will begin to see large firms testing the
waters for bulk email advertising.  

These are Fortune 200 & 500 Companies.  Airlines,
Insurance companies, Mortgage companies,
and leading catalog retailers.

How do we know this?  Because we have secured
one of these large firms as a client.  

If you haven't tapped-in on the power of bulk email,
then you're in for a treat.  Bulk Email is 100% legal
if done in a responsible manner.

For example, you will notice in the headers
of this email, we use a valid email address.
Our subject is not misleading and this 
ad-copy includes complete details about
our company.  We have nothing to hide.

If you are interested in learning more about
the lucrative business of bulk email, then you
need to be a member of The UnderWorld. 

The UnderWorld of Bulk Emailers is a password
protected website where you will find out all
of the secrets of bulk emailing.  We have a legal
information center,  an online forum where you
can post messages and converse with other members.

Best of all, you get access to the Whois Database
email addresses of domain owners.  Fresh email
addresses are added each month.  

For more details, visit our website.

email ad.  If you wish to get off of this list,  I will

Note to Flamers & Complainers:

Please overlook this one.  We are doing our
best here to be a responsible mailer.  If you
don't like UCE, then please tell me.  I certainly
do not want to send you email if you have
no interest in receiving it.  Please be fair
and ask to be removed.
