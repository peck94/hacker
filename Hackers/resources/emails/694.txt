Subject: 1:1 Ratio Banner Exchange, Fast & Reliable!


Site Administrator,
  	Greetings. I would like to announce the opening
 of our newest Banner Exchange, Be sure to read on about:
 Our Excellent Exchange Ratios, Our CHEAP Advertising Rates,
 Why we are the BEST, and how You can Own and Operate
 Your Own Banner Exchange.
 
 
 The Banner Exchange2
 http://www.bannerexchange2.com
 
 
 	We Now Offer a Banner Exchange with a 1 to 1 ratio of exchange.
 For every Banner  of ours that your site displays, we will in turn
 display one banner for your site throughout our network of sites,
 an even exchange.  Animated gifs are supported to 13,000 bytes with
 a 234*60 pixel banner.
  
 	We also do have our original system which gives a 2 to 1 ratio
 of exchange Using a 468*60 pixel banner.  For larger sites that
 display 5,000 banners or more a day we will gladly change the
 ratio of exchange for your site to a 4 to 3 ratio, in other words
 we will display your banner three times for every  four of ours that
 you display.  Clicks your site generates must be within our standards
 for this. Only have a site that does 1-3000 hits a day?  Use our
 multi-page code on your pages and you more than likely can exceed
 the 5,000 banner ad displays required for the 4 to 3 ratio.
 
 Tired of the high advertising rates that everyone seems to be Charging? 
 Can't make enough income to cover the advertising costs?
 
 Be sure to read on to see how we can assist you in several ways that Won't
 put you in the Poor House, but in fact make it possible for you to generate
 a profit from your site.  Also learn how you can own & operate your
 Own banner Exchange utilizing our custom software.
 
 Cheat Proof System
 ===============================================
 So you joined other systems just to see your proven
 banner get the lowest click-thru rate ever using this
 system.  Chances are that they have a lot of cheaters
 registered with them and probably don't even know it.
 Just think, a lot of those banner credits you earned
 are being burned up by another member just hitting
 reload repeatedly and your banner is seen by this
 cheater instead of other possible prospects as agreed.
 
 We have two systems that check for Cheaters/Thieves,
 test us out, see if you can cheat our system.  We also
 monitor where all click-thru's are coming from, when
 a member site just doesn't produce enough clicks from
 the banners they display,  we politely remove them
 from our system so that they don't reduce the overall
 click-thru ratio that our Members receive.
 ===============================================
 *******   We are Fast and Reliable   *******
 -----------------------------------------------
 ABOUT OUR INTERNET CONNECTION:
 -----------------------------------------------
 
 We utilize a Tier 2 Provider connected to a Tier 1 provider
 that is directly connected to the MAE-EAST, MAE-WEST, and
 AMERITECH Network access points via several DS-3's. This
 ensures some of the quickest network times almost anywhere.
 In most cases, we are only 2 hops off of the major US arteries.
 Do a trace route on any of the domain names listed below, then
 the competition, see how many hops they take, you be the judge,
 who takes their banner exchange service seriously?.
 
 ===============================================
 
 	We have a proven system that is second to none in
 speed and reliability. We aren't one of those shareware
 exchanges you see cluttering up the web with broken banners
 and far from accurate stats. 
 
 You won't find our banners broken or slowing your pages down,
 you know what I mean if you have tried the others.  Our database
 is very stable, our software incorporates an "Auto Backup &
 Restore System" in the event an error would occur.
 
 What does it really mean to you, the member, when you see 
 broken banners  on the web, especially when you are also a 
 member of that broken system???
 
 	It means that their database that is tracking
 everyone's statistics , is Simply BROKEN.  In other
 words the stats are not only corrupted but at the same
 time you are not earning credits for banners you display 
 during their down time.   
 
 	Here is a True Scenario of a system I tried on one
 of our sites. I tried this system because the site owner
 had contacted us in regards to our software and was interested
 in obtaining a copy of it.  He explained how the system was
 not very automated and that it was becoming a headache now
 that he's up to displaying  around 10,000 banner ads a day.
 This shocked me, only 10,000 and problems. This person runs
 his own server so computer overload with an ISP was not the
 case.  (FYI , he didn't know that the site we registered
 with his system was ours) After I joined I checked the stats
 of the account to see that it was working, then about every two
 weeks I went to check the stats and it always came up with an
 error, I didn't bother the site owner cause I felt bad that he
 was having such problems. After about two months I contacted
 him about this and it appears that the database file was gone,
 his system actually had no record of my membership, at this
 point I identified myself, our site displayed at least
 35-40,000 banners for him and our banner never got displayed
 (and still hasn't been displayed).  This is true, I apologize
 for the length  but just want you to know there IS a Difference
 among Banner Exchanges on the web.
