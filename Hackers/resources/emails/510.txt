Subject: Excite Tops Yahoo and Infoseek!

Excite came out the winner in a recent IntelliQuest survey that appeared
in the July 1 issue of USA TODAY. Participants were asked to rank
Excite, Yahoo and Infoseek in terms of entertainment, content, appeal
and ease of use. Results were as follows:

Excite: 89 percent
Yahoo: 87 percent
Infoseek: 84 percent

80 percent of all Web sessions begin at a major search engine. According
to Media Metrix Inc., Excite pulls 12.8 percent of the average monthly
minutes spent searching, second only to Yahoo! This includes 10 million
AOL users on AOL NetFind. If you're serious about generating thunderous
traffic (and profits) to your Web site, **Excite is a must.**
