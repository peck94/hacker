Hello

I found your address while performaing searches on www.snap.com on 
woman executives. My company is setting up pages with links and 
resources for female executives. (To be finished by the end of 
November)

We are also allocating a percent of our sales toward a scholarship fund 
and currently have full time positions available as well as internships 
around the country. If you know of places that can help me get the 
message out, please help me.

If your site has any information on female executives and you have a 
banner, please email it to us, or you know of sites that feature 
information on female executives please forward it to us.

Thank you

Bernadett Szodi  VP of European Operations
