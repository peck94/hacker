    "Make Money Immediately When You Own The Rights 
To Over 750 How-To Books, Reports, And Manuals WITHOUT 
                 Having To Pay 1 Penny In Royalties."


Dear Friend,

If you ever wanted a business where you could hit the ground 
running . . . a business where you could just open a box and 
start making immediate profits . . . a business that's completely 
set up and ready to pull in maximum sales . . . with a product 
that practically sells itself . . . then I've got some great news for 
you!

Hi! I've been in the Direct Mail business for several years 
and I'm always on the look-out for the "ultimate" product. 

You know, that once in-a-lifetime product . . . The kind of product 
that sells itself, has tremendous profits, makes customers happy, 
and can be offered on full auto-pilot roll-out.

While these types of products do exist, they are extremely rare, 
and most people in this business never get to feel the thrill that 
comes from the tidal wave of responses this type of product 
generates.

See, these days, the definition of the right product is a lot different 
than it was just a few years ago. The market has changed, 
consumers have changed, and even the methods of advertising 
products and taking orders have changed.

And this is good news! . . . 

You see, getting into the direct mail business is now easier than 
ever. With all the exciting new methods of reaching customers 
(e-mail, fax, the Internet, America Online, etc.), making real money 
with a direct mail project can be accomplished without ever leaving 
your desk!

Of course, even with all the great new methods of reaching customers, 
you still need the right product at the right time. And that's the hitch. 
It's hard to find the right product. 

Ask anyone in the business and they will tell you the same thing. 
(Yes, there are a lot of products out there. But most are, at best, 
a waste of time.)

Basically, it boils down to this . . .

If you want to make money in direct mail, and you want to make 
it quickly, you need to find the right product and offer it to the right 
market at the right time. 

And that's what this letter is all about . . . helping you find the 
right direct mail product (and project) for these times. A project 
you can roll-out effortlessly and make a lot of money quickly!

But before we go into that, let me share with you what I think are 
the key characteristics of the "right" direct mail project. See how 
many on this list you agree with.

Checklist For Finding The "Right" Direct Mail Project . . .

The "Right" Direct Mail Project will have all of the following 
characteristics:

• Potential customers want the product so badly they will 
respond to any ad that offers it! (This means you don't have to 
buy expensive ads. Simple, low-cost ads will do!)

• The product has such a high perceived value almost any 
price you charge seems like a bargain! (Customers value the 
product so highly they are happy and eager to pay your price!)

• The product appeals to people who have money, and who 
want to spend it now! (If you don't think this is important, try selling 
something to people who don't have money!)

• The product costs you only a fraction of the selling price! 
(You want a large enough profit so it only takes a few sales to 
make serious money!)

• The product is easy to ship, and easy to keep on hand. 
(You shouldn't have to worry about renting a warehouse to store 
inventory, or worry about how difficult it is to package and ship the 
product. You want it to be easy -- a "no brainer".)

• The product requires no support, and is self-sufficient. (You 
sure don't want to spend hours on the phone with customers 
explaining how to use the product!)

• Your customers call you back and order more. (When your 
customers actually get their hands on your product, you want 
them to be so impressed with what they received that they'll call 
you back and order more! You can double your profit on each sale 
by having the next product (the back-end) ready for them when they 
call!)

So what do you think? A pretty good wish list, right? And wouldn't 
you love to find a direct mail project with all these characteristics?

Well, if your answer is "Yes", then you're going to love the rest of 
this letter! 

If your answer is "no", then read on anyway. I guarantee you will 
be entertained and you might be surprised at what you discover. 
(But how could you not be interested in a product with all these 
characteristics?) 

Anyway . . . 

The direct mail business is a real adventure. 

Much like panning for gold. When it works, when you find gold 
in your pan, it's a lot of fun! And even when there's no gold in 
your pan, you're learning. You're learning how to pan, where to 
pan, and even what size pan to use.

So, I've been doing a lot of panning lately. And I've found a lot of 
gold. (Coming up with successful projects seems to get easier the 
more you do!) But more important than finding gold, I've come up 
with what I think is a better way to find gold in the first place.

And that way is to . . .

Sell Something To The Other Gold Miners!!!

While all the other miners are knee deep in mud panning for gold, 
I want you to be the one standing on dry land selling them the pans 
(or any other supplies they need). 

This is the way fortunes were made in the Old West. (Levi Jeans 
to name just one.) 

And it is the way fortunes are still being made today. By selling 
the tools miners (or entrepreneurs) need to find their fortune.

And that's what the "ultimate" product is all about. Showing YOU 
how to be the one who's selling the tools needed to make money!!!

Here's How It Works:

You know all those books, reports, and manuals you see advertised 
in the back of most magazines? The ones that show you "How To 
Start Your Own Direct Mail Business", or "How To Start Your Own 
Newsletter", or "How To Make $40 An Hour With Your Video 
Camera"? Well…

Those books and reports are the back-bone of the direct mail 
business. They have been around forever, and continue to be one 
of the easiest and most profitable ways for people to get into the 
direct mail business.

It's a fact. Ask almost anyone in the direct mail business today, 
and they'll tell you they got their start by running small ads for 
reports like, "How To Get Government Land Free" or "Sure Fire 
Ways Of Raising Instant Cash". 

And they'll also tell you the things they learned, and the money 
they earned from these ads led to bigger and better projects. But 
these first ads, they were the starting point.

Anyway, just about everyone has heard success stories about 
people selling these reports. (Have you heard the one about the 
housewife who sold 112,000 copies of a guide to grocery store 
coupons?) 

It is these stories, plus the ease of actually doing it, that tempts 
so many people to start out in this business by placing small ads 
offering various "how-to" books and reports. And that's where 
The Ultimate Direct Mail Project comes in . . .

See, because there are an estimated 30 million people wanting to 
get into the direct mail business, and most of these people will get 
their start selling how-to publications, we decided to put together 
the "ultimate package" that would appeal to them.

We did a lot of research, contacted writers and publishers, and 
after extensive negotiations (involving transfers of money), we were 
able to acquire the . . .

Reprint And Duplication Rights To Over 750
How-To Books, Reports And Manuals!!!

That's right, we secured the reprint and duplication rights to over 
750 "how-to" books, reports and manuals, the kind you see 
advertised in the backs of all the magazines! 

The subjects of these publications range from "Money Making" 
and "How To Get Into Business", to "How To Lose Weight" and 
"How To Have Better Health".

Like I said, these are the kind of books and reports you see 
advertised just about everywhere. Many were written by well 
known authors, many by unknowns. 

But all have one thing in common . . .

For Every One Of These Reports, 
There's Someone, Somewhere Willing To Pay For Them!

Just to give you an idea of the wide appeal of these reports, here 
are just some of the titles:

(These publications range from single page reports, to 40 page 
manuals, to 200 plus page books!)
