 Hello!!!   =)

 "Thank you for requesting more information about the Cable Television 
 Descrambler.
 I've been asked so many good questions that I left unanswered in my
 first letter.  For that reason, I have put together this Question & Answer letter. 
 I apologize in advance for not being able to answer each of your  
 questions personally.  The response has been overwhelming. "

 are included in my plans for each! 
 
 Q: Where can I find the 75pf-100pf variable capacitor, Radio Shack doesnt
 have it?   
 A: Many Radio Shacks do have it.  However, you have two other  
 options.  1st call a radio speciality supply store in your area that  
 is listed in the yellow pages.  2nd you can order the capacitor from me. 
 If needed I will mail you as many as you need for the price (s) below. Im not trying to make a profit out of it, just want to help you. Ill wrap it carefully and send it to you only if you send me a self addressed #10 size padded envelope,  with 64c postage affixed.
