Dear Friend:<BR>
Here is yet another opportunity to make some money.  Before you curse<BR>
and send this message to the recycle bin along with the multitude of<BR>
others that are dropped into your in-box everyday, please take a moment<BR>
to glance at the opportunity that presents itself here.  If you want to own<BR>
your own home business, need some extra income fast to pay off some<BR>
bills,  or for that long awaited vacation, or you need money for some other<BR>
reason, please keep an open mind and read the information that follows.<BR>
You won't be disappointed !  <BR>
<BR>
If you think that this program can be of benefit to you, you be the sole<BR>
judge, then by all means, participate.  After all, you really have nothing<BR>
to lose but $5.00 U.S. and a few hours of your time.<BR>
<BR>
Before we begin, here are some comments from people who have already<BR>
participated in this venture.<BR>
____________________________________<BR>
I want to share this with you.  I am sure, like me, you have tried many<BR>
different opportunities at home and most of them don't work, or they<BR>
want money we don't have.  I figured what's $5.00 when we have spent so<BR>
much more...Marie.<BR>
_____________________________________<BR>
Thought you might find this interesting.....I decided to try this one<BR>
also.  What's $5.00 (a couple of banana splits?) I figure what do I have<BR>
to lose but a few pounds?.......Cheryl<BR>
______________________________________<BR>
What's your business?  Need some fast cash?  Try this.  I want to tell<BR>
you that the only reason I am sending this is because earlier this year<BR>
I tried this program and it worked.  Hope you have much success also.<BR>
What the heck, the burger meal this $5.00 would buy would only turn into<BR>
fat anyhow......Cathy<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
      If you are prepared to read on, BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.....YOU<BR>
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!<BR>
******************************************************<BR>
Read the following and you will agree this is a very exciting<BR>
opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
Only invest a little bit of time and your reward could mean thousands of<BR>
dollars!!!!  Good luck!<BR>
<BR>
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!!!!  With 2 hours of work, I have made over US$11,000 <BR>
in the last three weeks....and my investment was just US$5.00!!!<BR>
I LOVE IT!!!  THANK YOU!!! 11,000 X's!!!  Julie M., St. Louis<BR>
******************************************************<BR>
$$$ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY?  RIGHT NOW?  $$$HOW DOES <BR>
up to US$10,000 IN TWO (2) WEEKS (or less) SOUND?<BR>
<BR>
Don't laugh, it is possible !  Try this for a change while you wait for the<BR>
others<BR>
to start working.<BR>
<BR>
If you need to make a few thousand dollars REALLY FAST, then please take<BR>
a moment to read this simple program I am sharing with you. No, it's NOT<BR>
what you think.  YOU DO NOT have to send $5.00 to five people to buy a<BR>
report, buy a recipe or any other product.  Nor will you need to invest<BR>
a fortune later to get things going.  THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST<BR>
PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!  Start it by investing just a few hours of<BR>
your time, and you will never forget the day you first received it. <BR>
If you are doing other programs, by all means, stay with them, but do this<BR>
program as well if you CAN'T WAIT two or three months while your other<BR>
programs start to work for you.<BR>
<BR>
***This is How it Works****<BR>
Unlike many other programs, this three-level program is more realistic<BR>
and much, much faster.  Because it is so easy, the response rate for<BR>
this program is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST and you will see results in two<BR>
weeks or less!!!  Just in time for next month's bills.<BR>
<BR>
You only mail out 20 copies of this E-Mail. (more will give you better<BR>
results).<BR>
You should send them to PEOPLE WHO SEND YOU THEIR PROGRAMS because<BR>
they know THESE PROGRAMS WORK and they are already believers in the<BR>
system!!  Besides, this program is much, much FASTER and has a HIGHER<BR>
RESPONSE RATE.<BR>
<BR>
Even if you are already in a program, STAY WITH IT, but do yourself a<BR>
favor and DO THIS ONE as well.  START RIGHT NOW!!!  It's simple and<BR>
takes a very small investment.  It will pay off long before other<BR>
letters ever begin to trickle in.<BR>
<BR>
Just give ONE person a US$5.00 bill as shown below.  That's all!  Follow the<BR>
simple<BR>
instructions and in as little as TWO WEEKS you could have thousands of dollars<BR>
in<BR>
your bank account!!!  Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT<BR>
POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE.  JUST ONE(1)<BR>
US$5.00 BILL.  THAT'S YOUR INVESTMENT!!!!<BR>
<BR>
****Follow These Simple Instructions*****<BR>
<BR>
#1.  On a blank sheet of paper write "Please add me to your mailing list".<BR>
Write your name and address clearly and include your email address (if<BR>
you have one) for future mailing and courtesy follow-ups.  Fold it + one more<BR>
blank<BR>
sheet of paper around a US$5.00 bill and send this to the FIRST name on the<BR>
list (#1).<BR>
Only the FIRST PERSON on the list gets YOUR NAME AND A FIVE DOLLAR GIFT.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE:  This is a service and is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal and<BR>
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005<BR>
in the US Code, also in the Code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16,<BR>
Sections 255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be<BR>
exchanged for money received".  This is also legal in Canada, by the<BR>
way.<BR>
You are paying someone $5.00 to be placed on their private mailing list.  <BR>
Keep track of all of the e-mails and addresses you receive, and<BR>
if you come across any good business opportunities in the future, you can<BR>
send them to the people on your list.  This is an excellent Service that will<BR>
surely<BR>
help everyone involved.  You are basically keeping an eye out for Business<BR>
Opportunities for people.<BR>
<BR>
#2.  Retype the list ONLY REMOVING THE FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST.<BR>
Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD<BR>
(#3) position.<BR>
<BR>
#3.  Send out 20 copies of this letter (minimum).  Note:  By sending this<BR>
letter<BR>
via email the response time is much faster and you save the expense of<BR>
envelopes, stamps and copying services.<BR>
<BR>
*********************************************************************<BR>
Consider this:  MILLIONS of people "sure the Internet" everyday, all<BR>
day, all over the World!! FIFTY THOUSAND new people get on the Internet<BR>
every month!!  An excellent source of names is the people who send you<BR>
other programs, and the names listed on the letter they send you.  Your<BR>
contact source is UNLIMITED.  <BR>
<BR>
Also, you can do the following to get more business :<BR>
<BR>
(a).  Place Free Classified ADS.  Here are a few free (or low cost) sites :<BR>
<BR>
http://www.freeclassifieds.com/<BR>
http://webcom.com/abc/abchome.html<BR>
http://www.dollarads.com  --------- FREE for the first week<BR>

http://www.freeclassifieds.com <BR>
http://accnet.com/homes/selectform.html    <BR>
http://www.adsearch.com/     <BR>
<BR>
**To find more sites which offer free advertising, go to "Search Engines"<BR>
and enter the words "free classified ads".  Some sample Search Engines :<BR>
<BR>
* Alta Vista --   http://www.altavista.digital.com/<BR>
* Excite  ------   http://www.excite.com/<BR>
* Infoseek ----   http://www.infoseek.com/<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(b).  Join a "Safe List" club.  Basically, these are people who want to hear<BR>
about new opportunities and that is the main purpose of the club.  Try these<BR>
web sites for more info :<BR>
<BR>
* http://www.theskynetwork.com/join.html<BR>
* http://www.safelist.com/lists/spyhoppe.shtml<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(c).  You can try "Bulk E-Mail".  Go to one of the Search Engines listed<BR>
above, and do a search using the words, "Bulk E-Mail".  A Bulk E-Mail<BR>
Service will mail your letter to thousands of people (minimum is often<BR>
50,000 e-mails), to Business Opportunity seekers or whoever you want.<BR>
Prices vary, but, try not to spend over $100.00 to start.  Also, be sure to<BR>
check out<BR>
the Better Business Bureau at http://www.bbb.com, before doing business<BR>
with any company.  In addition, please note that Bulk E-Mailing is not<BR>
illegal at this time.  Internet Service Providers (ISP) are concerned about <BR>
"Spamming", which means to send unsolicited e-mail to someone who didn't <BR>
ask for it and by not providing a return e-mail address.  The bottom line is,<BR>
if <BR>
you want to use this method of marketing, and you include your return e-mail <BR>
address, your ISP will likely receive complaints and cancel your account.  It<BR>
is<BR>
best to talk to various Bulk E-Mail companies and see what kind of services<BR>
they offer.  They may be able to help you.  This is a very powerful way to get<BR>
your message out, but, do your research first.<BR>
<BR>
It boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities!!  Mail, or should I say<BR>
email, <BR>
your letter TODAY!!  It's so easy.    <BR>
To send this newsletter by email:<BR>
<BR>
1.  Go to "Edit" and "Select All"<BR>
2.  Go to "Edit" and "Copy"<BR>
3.  Start (compose) a new email message<BR>
4.  Address your email and subject blocks<BR>
5.  Go to "Edit" and "Paste"<BR>
<BR>
In the "Subject" area, put anything you want.  Here are some suggestions :<BR>
<BR>
EARN UNLIMITED INCOME WORKING FROM HOME !<BR>
<BR>
EARN $5,000+/MONTH WORKING FROM HOME !<BR>
<BR>
START YOUR OWN HOME BASED BUSINESS TODAY !<BR>
<BR>
After you have pasted this article in your new email, delete the old<BR>
header and footer (Subject, date, to from, etc.).  Now you can edit the<BR>
names and addresses with ease.  I recommend deleting the top name,<BR>
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply<BR>
changing the numbers.  THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.  When your name<BR>
reaches the first position in a few days, it will be your turn to<BR>
receive some business.  The money will be sent to you by thousands of<BR>
people like yourself, who are willing to invest US$5.00 and some time, to<BR>
receive up to US$10,000, or more, in cash.  That's all!!!   There could be a<BR>
total of<BR>
US$10,000 (or more) in US$5.00 bills in your mailbox in a few weeks !<BR>
<BR>
I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?  GO AHEAD---TRY IT, IT'S US$5.00!! <BR>
EVEN IF YOU JUST MAKE 3 OR 4 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT <BR>
BE NICE?  IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!!!<BR>
<BR>
****************True Story********************<BR>
Cindy Allen writes:  I ran this program four times last year.<BR>
The first time I received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks and<BR>
over $10,000 in cash in the next three times I ran it.  I can't begin to<BR>
tell you how great it feels not to have to worry about money anymore!!!<BR>
Thank God for the day I received this letter!! It has truly changed my<BR>
life.   So let's keep it going and help each other in these<BR>
"tough and uncertain times". Many of us just want to pay off our bills,<BR>
buy a new car or buy a new home for our family.  Whatever your reasons<BR>
or needs are, this program worked for Cindy, and thousands of others<BR>
(just like you and I) time and time again!  THIS PROGRAM CAN AND WILL<BR>
WORK FOR YOU!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
**********Can I Do It Again************<BR>
OF COURSE YOU CAN.....This plan is structured for everyone to send only<BR>
twenty (20) letters each.  However, you are certainly not limited to<BR>
twenty.  Mail out as many as you can.  If you can mail forty, sixty, eighty or<BR>
whatever, GO FOR IT!!!  THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT, THE MORE YOU<BR>
GET OUT OF IT!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Each time you run this program, just follow the steps (1) through (3)<BR>
and everyone on your list benefits.  Simple enough? You bet it is.<BR>
Besides, there is no inventory to buy, no further trips<BR>
to the printer or copiers, and you can do it again and again whenever<BR>
needed.  Remember, however, that the purpose of a business is to have the<BR>
potential<BR>
of earning a profit.  So, you should do this at least once a year, for as long<BR>
as you<BR>
want to run this business.  Some people produce a mailing list of opportunity<BR>
seekers<BR>
and send out 200 or more.<BR>
Why not?  It beats working.  Each time you receive a MLM offer in the<BR>
mail, respond with THIS letter.  Your name will climb to the number one<BR>
position at dizzying geometric rates.<BR>
<BR>
Follow the simple instructions and above all, please "PLAY FAIR".<BR>
That's the key to this program's success.  Your name must run the "full<BR>
gamut" on the list to produce the end results.  "Sneaking" your name<BR>
higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the results you think and it only<BR>
cheats the other people who have worked hard and earned the right to be<BR>
there.  So please, play by the rules and the $$$$ will come to you!!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Example :<BR>
<BR>
*Person who receives this message e-mails 20 copies.<BR>
*Each of those 20 people e-mail 20 copies each = 400 copies. <BR>
*Each of these 400 people mail 20 e-mails each = 8,000 x $5.00 = $40,000.00<BR>
<BR>
That totals $40,000.00 to YOU ! (This is only a hypothetical example, but, it <BR>
could happen) .... but, only IF you start by placing your name in the #3<BR>
position. <BR>
Yes, the possibilities are amazing, but, that is the <BR>
advantage of using E-Mail (and the Internet) and Multi Level Marketing<BR>
together,<BR>
at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
***********Mail Your Letters Out Today***********<BR>
$$$TOGETHER WE WILL PROSPER$$$$$  Mail your US$5.00 bill to the first<BR>
name on the list ONLY.  Wrap the $5.00 bill in two pieces of paper, with your<BR>
name, <BR>
and E-Mail address (and postal address also) written on one of the sheets of<BR>
paper, <BR>
and the note :  "please place me on your mailing list".  Remove the first name<BR>
and move the other two up one place and put your name in  the #3 position.<BR>
GOOD LUCK!!!!<BR>
