Subject:  Stalked. Kidnapped. Raped! I survived. Learn more.
Message-ID: <284746302948@uu.net>



My name is Elaine Forberg and I am a survivor of violent crime.

I was stalked, kidnaped, tortured, brutalized and raped repeatedly.   


I WAS one of the 95% of Americans who never thought it necessary

to carry any form of self protection.  I just did not believe that

violence would ever happen to me, despite the glaring fact that one's

chances of becoming a victim of violent crime increased 460% in the

U.S. over the past three decades.


Crime is not selective of any particular person, it can happen to

anyone.  Learn that YOU have the power and ability to protect

yourself, because you are worth protecting! 


The time is now...call 1-800-400-1972 ext. 1948  for FREE inform-

ation that may save your life.


Thank you,


Elaine Forberg

Founder, Help Fight Crime
