  * Get Immediate Attention For Your Web site *

For Less Than 10 Cents Each, We Will Submit Your
Web Site To Over 400 Of The Nets Hottest Search
Engines, Directories, and Indexes. That's only
$39.95.

   Visit our site or read on to learn more.

    http://www.thewebsitedoctor.com/info.htm

That's right... In just  72 HOURS  we will have your
site in the hands of over 400 search engines, 
directories and indexes where millions of buyers 
are going every day to find web sites just like yours.

Your web site will be available to be see by millions
and millions of prospects. 

It's a fact that over 90% of today's internet users
use search engines to locate providers of products, 
services or information.  That's why it is SO 
IMPORTANT that you immediately take advantage 
of this Excellent Opportunity and increase your 
exposure to the world's marketplace.

It's true what the old saying says  - "no one 
ever sees a candle that's hidden under a basket."  
It's the same for your web site.  

*  Is your web site hidden under a basket?
*  Can prospects easily find your web site?

>From one business person to another, let me
ask this question - If prospects can't find your 
web site, then how do you expect to make any
money from it ???  You Can't....

You'll be amazed at how easy it is to immediately
get the kind of exposure your web site needs to 
be successful.

Who uses our service?

Universities, Colleges, Medical Facilities,
Government Facilities, Trade Bureaus, Chambers
Of Commerce, Travel Agents/Agencies, An Enormous
Variety Of On-line Shops Selling Everything Kind
Of Product, Service, Or Information You Can Imagine,
Hotels, Motels, Bed & Breakfasts, Vacation Spots.
The List Goes On And On...

A good question you might be asking yourself is
"Why should I pay these guys even 10 cents to
do this? Can't I do it myself?"

The answer is - sure you can but let me
ask you this - 

Isn't your time worth more than 10 cents???

It sure had better be !!!

You know as well as I do that your time is
best utilized managing your business and not
sitting at some keyboard hours upon hours
trying to save less than 10 cents for each  
submission. See how it's kind of crazy to try
to tackle this on your own.  It's just not 
cost effective to try to do this yourself.

Not to mention that you will be totally nuts 
within 2 days of attempting to do this and 
you'll be pulling your hair out and wanting
to throw your keyboard across the room :-)

Another good question you might be asking is
"OK, this almost sounds too good to be true.
I've seen other companies that charge several
hundred dollars for this type of service and
you're telling me that you can do it for less
than 10 cents each?" What's the catch ???

There isn't one...

We have invested thousands and thousands of 
dollars into state-of-the-art equipment and custom
software which makes this all manageable.  As a 
matter of fact, we are so fully automated that we 
can handle several thousand submissions per day.

*******************

100% NO QUESTIONS ASKED MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:

We are so sure of our services that we provide 
you with a 100% No Questions Asked money back 
guarantee for 30 days from the date of the 
placement of your order.  

To prevent abuse of our guarantee, if a refund
is made, we will reverse all submission work 
done by us. That's only fair...

*******************


SPECIAL NOTE:

I am going to go ahead and say this as it saves
us countless hours upon hours of wasted phone
time so here goes...

We are a United States based, family owned and 
operated business and are very proud of it.  
We have owned various internet businesses for 
over 3 years. We have always taught our family 
members that they should strive to have the goal
of being responsible people who always try
to live to certain high standards and values.
It's the best way to live and conduct ones 
business.  I hope that you agree with me.

As such, I am sure that you'll allow me the 
time here to say - WE DO NOT ACCEPT WORK FROM;

1) Adult XXX sites, or 2) sites that promote hate 
or violence towards others based upon race, 
color, ethnic origin, religion, gender or other 
issues.  These sites are unacceptable to us 
and are very often also considered illegal by 
the United States Government or State or 
Local codes.  

So, if this is your type of web site -
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME. DON'T EVEN CALL
We won't take your business. WE DON'T WANT IT.

Now, with that said, let's move on...
*********************

==========================
       ORDER FORM
==========================


Place an "X" by the level of service you want:

Why different levels?  You will find that over time
your web site will just "Disappear" from some
search engines, directories and indexes.  The 
reason for this varies from each one but the
fact remains that your site will just DROP
OFF THE LIST.  That is why it is important
to be sure to resubmit your site on occasion.

Our most popular package is the 4 times
submission package because it provides
you with a complete submission to all the
search engines, directories and index we
use EVERY THREE MONTHS for a full year.  Our 
clients who are professional webmasters for 
others recommend this to their own clients.  
They also tend to use this level themselves.

_____  1 time submission, $ 39.95
We submit your web site one time. This 
program is considered "FAIR"


_____  2 times submission, $ 59.95
We submit your web site once immediately
and again in 6 months. This program is 
considered "GOOD"

_____  3 times submission, $ 79.95
We submit your web site once immediately
and again in 6 months and again in 9
months. This program is considered 
"BETTER"

_____  4 times submission, $ 99.95
We submit your web site once immediately
and then once each 3 months for one year.
This program is considered " B E S T " and
is used by most professional webmasters.
It is our most popular selection.

_____ 12 times submission, $259.95
We submit your site monthly for an entire
year.  This program is considered "Overkill 
for most." This should be used by businesses
that are selling large ticket items where the loss
of a single sale outweighs the increased
cost of this package.

KEYWORDS:

What are keywords or key phrases?  These are
the words that people will enter into the search 
engines to try to find your type of product or 
service.  So, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you think
carefully about what words your prospects will
use to try to find you.

An example would be, if you sell paint, then 
paint should be one of your key words.  If you 
sell cessna airplanes, then aircraft, airplane,
aviation, and cessna would be keywords that 
you would want to use. 

You can also use "Key Phrases."  This is like 
the words, ski resort, mountain hiking, medical
facilities, travel agency, etc.

You can list up to 16 keywords or keyword 
phrases.  Note: Keyword phrases count as one
word but don't get carried away with that idea.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING
A KEY PHRASE AS WE CAN'T USE IT;
mountain hiking biking skiing surfing scuba

Keep your key phrases limited to 2-3 words 
max.  They must match what your prospect will
be typing in to find you.

Many of the search engines will take your list 
of keywords and they will place the most emphasis
( importance ) on the first word in the list and 
then give less importance to the 2nd word then 
less to the 3rd word and so forth with the least 
amount of importance given to the 16th word.  
Therefore, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you list 
them in the order of #1 being THE MOST 
IMPORTANT, then number 2 being less 
important than #1 but more important than 
#3 etc.

List them from 1 to 16 in the order of most 
important being #1 to the least important being 
#16.  Key words can be two words i.e. ski 
vacation, or hospital room, or Dallas Texas.

TITLE OF YOUR WEB PAGE:

What is the title of your web page?  These are the 
words that will appear at the VERY TOP of your 
internet browsers window.  Go to a particular
site and you can see it for yourself.  It is at the 
Very Top of your screen assuming that your 
browser is taking up the full screen of your 
monitor. 

The title is not to be taken lightly.  Search 
engines often times will use this information as 
well to help position your site in the list of 
others that come up when people are searching for
your products or services. 

Your company name is important but often not as 
important as including some of your keywords in 
the title.  For example, if you did sell Cessna 
aircraft, a good title might be like this:

Cessna Aircraft - aircraft sales and service. 
Johnson Aircraft, Los Angeles.

Title of Your Web Page (Create one if you don't
have one - 10 words max)


Title: __________________________________________

_________________________________________________



Web Site Description:

What is a web site description?  This is one to
two sentences telling people about your web 
site, your company, and what you offer.  This
will appear in many search engines as a "snap
shot" as to what your site is about.

Your web site description is limited to 25 words
or less.  Here is how you fill out the form below.
Take a piece of paper and write down what you 
want your sites description to be (like 
mentioned above).  Once you are happy with 
your 1-2 sentences, then take each of the words
and place them in the spaces provided below.  
Put the first word of your sentence in spot #1, 
the second word in spot #2, the 3rd word in spot 
#3, and so on until you have completed all 
25 spots.
