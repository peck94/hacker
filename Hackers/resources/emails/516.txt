help. Note all prices are in US$ funds. We provide the following solutions:

1. Bulk Email Services

Let us send out your ad for you. It can be of any length, but must not be illegal in nature, or be of a 
pornographic nature. The list below is a general pricing. We can customize how many you want sent out.

2. WebSite Search Engine Promotion

One key factor for getting people to go to your website is to have your site on search engines. The more 
search engines you are listed on, the more hits from your intended audience you'll receive. When including 
this option, we need the following criteria:

- website to be submitted
- keywords to be used(max. 25)
- Title of Web Site
- 30 word description

Also, we allow multiple submissions, which will allow maximum exposure. As well, every so often, sites 
will bump your listing down so it is a good idea to have the same site, submitted at least once a month, to 
guarantee to maintain your listing at the top.

100 engines & directories - 15.00
