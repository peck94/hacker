Subject: ONE WAY TO MAKE IT!
Message-Id: <199808111447NAA10715@JJADDA.hollywood.com>

THIS IS A TRUE STORY.

When I first received this letter it got my attention for one reason. It said:
WE ARE A SERIOUS GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE MONEY!!!

I had read these e-mails before and deleted them, but I decided to try this one. I sent my $5.00 to each of the five names on the list.....that was 3 months ago....every person who's name is on this list has sent me $5.00, every one of them!!! So I am sending this e-mail out  to tell you that this really works and that if you need money, this is ONE way to get it!
IT WORKS..IT WORKS.. IT WORKS.. IT WORKS.. IT WORKS.. IT WORKS!!!!
Well, here goes:
A little while back, I was reading my e-mails, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this one. The article said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks, with an initial investment of ONLY $25.00! So I thought, "Yeah, right, this must be a joke," but like most people I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that if you send $5.00 to each Of the 5 names and addresses stated in the article that every person  who received your $5.00 would put your name on their mailing list and E-MAIL the new list to 500 people.  No catch, that was it. I WAS VERY skeptical but I knew that I could use some more money in my life. So I decided to risk $25.00, I have wasted more than that when AOL was billing me hourly on many occasions....(sound familiar) I thought it was about time that I found out if any of this was true. I never believed that this thing would actually work but even if it didn't, what are 5 stamps and $25.00 for a try?  I did know ONE thing!!
  NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS FREE, IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST BE WILLING TO PAY A PRICE!
 MONEY IS NOT FREE!!

Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I still figured it would end soon, and didn't give it another thought. But the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $20.00,to $30.00 dollars.
By the end of the second week I had made a total of  $500.00! ! ! ! 
In the third week I had over $3,000 and it was still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $5885.00 and it's still coming in . . . . .All of this and the only thing I did was follow the instructions and send $5.00 to the five names on the list!!!!!!

The reason this program works is because you are paying for a service. The service you are paying for is to have a person add your name to their mailing list and to e-mail the new list, with YOUR NAME attached, to 500 people. You are employing someone to do a job for you. 
People are using this method to make money the exact same way that Insurance companies were founded...everybody puts in a little to give a lot to one person at a time, until everybody has more money than they had to begin with....it's fantastic!  If you think about that theory you will understand that it makes a lot of sense..
Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST AND E-MAIL MY NAME TO 500 PEOPLE- ENCLOSED IS THE $5.00 PROCESSING FEE." Now get 5 $5.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will NOT be seen through the envelope. Next, place the folded paper with the $5.00 inside in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them.
You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the following phrase "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST, AND E MAIL MY NAME TO 500 OTHER PEOPLE,  ENCLOSED IS THE $5 PROCESSING FEE." This person now works for you!!!     Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses:
Don't forget to conceal the cash within the envelope! ! !
After you do your part, every person that you mail it to will e-mail this same letter out to 500 other people on the Internet with your name on the list. It's just that simple...The names just keep going and going  until your name is up to be removed.

Be willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new people are using this method to make money everyday...you won't get rich but you CAN get out of debt.... use the money to take a VACATION...buy a NEW CAR...whatever...
As with anything else, the results of this program cannot be guaranteed, but neither was waking up this morning. You got to give it a try for it to work for you. Remember, none has ever succeeded without, first, putting forth effort and pressing their own desire to win.
