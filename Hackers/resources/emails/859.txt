According to Canada's Income Tax Act, the interest earned on certain life
insurance policies is tax-sheltered. By moving money from your bank account
to your insurance account, you save tax dollars that can be used to pay
your insurance costs. This gives you the opportunity to prepay your
insurance in as little as 5 or 10 years. For example,
Male Age 50 Non-Smoker:

$100,000 Tax-Free Estate Benefit,

$1,573 Annual Deposit for 10 years
$17,077 Value in 10 years
$31,730 Value in 20 years
$250,000 Tax-Free Estate Benefit,

$3,608 Annual Deposit for 10 years
$40,887 Value in 10 years
$77,817 Value in 20 years
$500,000 Tax-Free Estate Benefit,

$6,913 Annual Deposit for 10 years
$80,105 Value in 10 years
$154,595 Value in 20 years
$1,000,000 Tax-Free

Estate Benefit, $13,656 Annual Deposit for 10 years
$159,340 Value in 10 years
$308,600 Value in 20 years

Values are based on 10 years of deposits and an assumed interest rate of
10%, and are not guaranteed. Actual values and duration of deposits will
depend on market conditions. This tax-advantaged policy is issued by one of
North America's largest life insurance companies, and allows you to
accumulate substantial values and create a tax-free estate benefit.
