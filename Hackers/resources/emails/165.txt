Here is a sample of a Market Alert.

Conectisys Corp. (OTC BB: CNES) $4.00 per share.
Upon request from Brian Volmer at SunPacific, I met with the senior management and technical personnel at Conectisys Corp., on Wednesday, April 29, 1998.  I have thoroughly reviewed the Company's literature, SEC filings, and most of the vital corporate documents pertaining to the product technology, strategic partnerships, and the status of current sales and marketing programs.

Conectisys' primary technology, the PrimeLink data gathering and acquisition hardware/software solution utilizes: Leading open systems interface (OSI) architecture design; A very unique and powerful  proprietary embedded-software kernel in both its board level digital signal processing (DSP) and its high-speed redundant wireless network;  and State of the art data processing techniques.

Conecticsys' products ands design team proved to be exceptional.  I discussed the design, manufacturing, and theoretical implementation issues of the system, as well as, its technology (both hardware & software) with the Company's chief scientist.  I was able to bench test the Transcomm unit. The product and wireless connection performed 
faultlessly during repeated tests.  This is the same unit ConEdison is currently implementing along one of their primary distribution networks for industrial/commercial customers, approximately 4,000 units.

Network (LAN/WAN) management, control, and configuration are the most important issues for MIS/IT managers in large companies, and even more critical at the large utilities where the system is first being
implemented.  The network-software UI (user interface) proved to be very easy to use.  It is dynamic in its system management, control, and configuration capabilities.

I was able to verify the ConEdison contract, whereby ConEdison is committed to purchasing the PrimeLink system for one of its primary power distribution networks.  Conectisys is currently finalizing a minor, but time consuming data processing software configuration issue surrounding the billing formats.  That is to say the physical bill which customers receive via mail or electronically.

The Conectisys AMR hardware (automatic meter reading) is inter-operable with the ConEdison meters; the wireless network is up and ready to transmit and receive data; the NOC (network operations center) is configured to receive the ConEdison AMR data bursts and re-transmit it to the data processing center where it will be formatted to be sent in the form of a bill to the end user.

Based upon my examination, I believe the Company will have the data processing formats in place and be ready to roll out the ConEdison system order in early June, 1998 which should translate into Q3 1998 (8/98) profitability.  I also believe the Company's technology and products (both current and future generations to be released within 12-months) will be instrumental to the Utility Industry in their quest to compete in a deregulated environment.  Conectisys also has developed other products and technology directed at non-utility industry applications which are currently being considered for pilot programs by several large commercial users.

My price target for 1998 at a reasonable Price to Earnings Ratio is 20 dollars a share. CNES close on 5/1/98 at 4 dollars per share. The shares should climb to 40 dollars in 1999.
