IS THIS FOR YOU?



If you answer "yes" to ANY of these questions, then this business is 
definitely for you:


1. Do you already have a home office in place? (Personal computer, fax 
capabilities, answering machine, etc.)

2. Do you have an extra 5 - 10 hours per week to commit toward building 
your own part-time (or full-time) business?

3. Would you be able to read from a script, clearly, and with enthusiasm,
 a 2 - 3 minute introduction of our products? (NO "cold-calling" is 
required. Our prospects will call you!)

4. With our system, on average, every 15 calls you make will generate a 
sale that pays you a commission in excess of $1,000. Can you make that 
many calls per week? (Per day?)



We are quote looking for a few quality people with the work ethic nece-
ssary to generate a cash-flow for themselves of $2,000 - $5,000 per week, 
with theintent to increase that to over 5-figures per month, in as little
as six months. Someone who can intelligibly read a short script to our 
qualified leads, and then turn the interested prospects over to our 
electronic sales medium. You will not be required to do any selling. 



If you have the self-discipline to ignore the TV for a couple of hours per 
day, and if you are looking for a legitimate home-based business opportun-
ity,( this is NOT multi-level marketing, or a chain-letter scheme), then 
please call our toll-free number, 1-800-995-0796 ext.4215 leave us a 
message, and we will get right back to you.



We market a real product, that pays real commissions to you, just for 
making the initial contacts. With our lead generation systems you will 
always talk to people who actually WANT to talk to you,



If you answered "YES" to any or all of the above questions, and don't
 mind earning an extra $1,000, on average, for every 15 phone calls you 
make, then call this toll-free number:


          Call For More Info. 1-800-995-0796 ext. 4215

(Be sure and include the best time for us to reach you.)



You have nothing to lose, there is quote no risk involved, and you may 
be qualified to earn thousands of extra dollars per month.



Prosperous regards,



Angela and Walter



P.S. It is SUGGESTED that you already have a functional home office
 situation. This greatly reduces your start-up and operating costs, and 
facilitates you being able to begin immediately. Please, serious 
inquiries only.

Thank you for your time.
