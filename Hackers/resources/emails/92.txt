Wall Street analysis from Harvard Equity Research has issued a
STRONG BUY recommendation on SUNN stock.  William Rambo
was quoted as predicting a $2.00 price near-term with "sustained
momentum into the $5.00 range by the 4th quarter of 1998".

$3 to $9.00 in ten trading days!

they are offering their subscribers a money-back guarantee on their

on SUNN.
