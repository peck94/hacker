Subject: ADV: Water Conditioning / Softening Secret

Hello,
Do you use or drink water. (of course you do :-) )

This could be of interest to you. 

Skeptical? 
That's OK, in fact that's good.
But don't say, "no" until you have all the information!

This definitely is worth looking into!

This is your invitation to view information on a little known
product in the U. S., that has been in use for 40 + years in 
Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

First of all I want you to be aware this is not 
a water purification system!
Nor is it about a traditional and expensive water softener
which uses salt.

The system takes nothing out of the water 
nor does it add anything.

But you can!!
Enjoy all the benefits, of conditioned /softened water.
With out having to take out a 2nd mortgage... 
and hump 40-80 pound bags of salt!
Or pay the c-man upwards of $40 a month.

Of course you can do nothing and continue as you are.

But!! A product with all the benefits that this one provides ??,
You'll want to know more!!

It was originally developed by the U.S. government 
for NASA's Space Program.

References:
Pepsi uses it!!
Coke uses it!!
Holiday INN uses it for their 
ice machines and swimming pools!!

Possible Benefits include:
Improved Water Clarity: 
Improved Taste of Water.
General Therapeutic Effects (digestive, nervous, urinary) 
Reduced Acidity & Better Regulated Body pH
More Efficient Absorption of Calcium & Nutrients (minerals)

and appliances!(and your coffee maker ect. will last longer!)

Gardeners!! Your Plants will thrive!!
Wash your car (and dishes) with almost no spotting!

Washing clothes, will require less soap!
AND Look New plus Last Longer!!

If you own a swimming pool or spa, don't miss this info!
Cut your maintenance and chemical costs by 25% or more!

No operating costs. 
Never another expense for the system.
Maintenance free.
Installs in minutes, no tools necessary!
Install one time and enjoy.

Enjoy all the benefits, of conditioned, /softened water.
Year after year!
