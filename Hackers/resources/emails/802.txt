 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Due to <BR>
the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below , to see if it really can make people money.  If you saw it, you know that their conclusion was ,that while most people did not make the $55,000, as discussed in the plan, EVERYONE who followed the instructions was able to make 100 to 160 times their money at the VERY LEAST . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> Hi, my name is Ken. After I saw this letter aired on the news program,I decided to get some of my skeptical questions answered.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Question #1</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> - Does it really work? Until I try it, I can only go on the testimony of people I don't know,so I will only know if I try it. I've never done this type of thing, but I decided<BR>
it was time to try something. If I keep doing what I am doing I'll keep getting what I've got.  Besides, people 70 years old have been surveyed and they will consistently say<BR>
 that the 2 regrets they have of there lives are;<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>            1) they wish they had spent more time with their families and<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Question #2 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- Is it legal? - Yes, (Refer to title 18, Section 1302 & 1342 of the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws)<BR>
This opportunity isn't much of a risk and could turn out to actually be a bit of fun. <BR>

             <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is what you MUST do:   <BR>
<BR>
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).    <BR>
     *  For each report, send </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>$5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE         <BR>
        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR        <BR>
        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> (in case of a problem) to the person whose         <BR>
        name appears on the list next to the report.  <BR>
<BR>
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four        <BR>
        reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save them        <BR>
        on your computer and resell them.  <BR>
<BR>
     *  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports.         <BR>
         Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send         <BR>
         to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.        <BR>
     <BR>
2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next  to       <BR>
 each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is  instructed      <BR>
below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once you  understand the way this works, you'll also see how         <BR>
 <U>it doesn't work if you change it. </U> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Remember, this method  has been tested,        <BR>
and<U> if you alter it, it will not work.</U>    <BR>
<BR>
 a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.        <BR>
        <BR>
 b. After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address under        <BR>
  REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that was there       <BR>
  down to REPORT #2.          <BR>
<BR>
 c.Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to .        <BR>
  REPORT #3 <BR>
  <BR>
 d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to         <BR>
   REPORT#4<BR>
               <BR>
  e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from        <BR>
         the list and has NO DOUBT collected large sums of cash!   <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=18>        <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>        <BR>
3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save  it to       <BR>
     your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this  letter.       <BR>
        <BR>
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the        <BR>
   WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be very, very inexpensive,        <BR>
   and there are </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. Another avenue which       <BR>
   you could use for advertising is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under        <BR>
   $20/2,000 addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you.      <BR>
            <BR>
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!        <BR>
        <BR>
5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report         <BR>
     they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL         <BR>
      ORDERS! This will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR       <BR>
      name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't  advertise until     <BR>
      they receive the report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.  <BR>

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 50 orders for REPORT #2.

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.         <BR>

    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 19 weeks, with money still coming in.        <BR>

    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn'tdelete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!        <BR>

     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!        <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> I am nearing the $90,000 mark from this program.I have used several forms of    <BR>
 advertisement.I used regular mail and bulk e-mail.  The regular mail that I used <BR>
 was very expensive for two reasons. I purchased a very select list of names              <BR>
 and the postage. The third time I sent e-mails out,I did so in the quantity of <BR>
 1 million. So, after 3 times participating in this program I am almost at the<BR>
 $90,000 mark. That isn't too bad. I hope the same success for you. .<BR>
 Good Luck.<BR>
