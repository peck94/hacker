What are YOUR answers to these questions??


Afraid your credit wouldn't allow you 
to get the computer you want?


Have you been wanting a new computer,
but were wondering if you can afford it?  



Do you want to learn more about:


**  The Internet
**  Your Computer
**  Building your own web sites for 
personal or business use
     and then selling them for a profit?


. but don't want to pay for those costly courses?


If you answered YES to one or more of these questions, then this is the
opportunity for YOU !!


Not only can you indulge yourself with a new computer (regardless of your
credit history)  
and provide yourself with ongoing, online education, 
you can also earn money doing so!!
