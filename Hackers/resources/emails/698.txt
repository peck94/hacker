There are, however, some network marketing companies that are . . .
get-rich-quick scams, that is.  Some, like Amway and NuSkin and
Herbalife and Mary Kay, have been around for years and have provided
lucrative incomes for thousands of people who were willing to work very
hard for a few years so they could do whatever they pleased for the rest
of their years.  That's what we're doing and that's what we're offering
you.

We decided to start a network marketing business when we learned that one of the most successful and respected
people in the industry was president of a new network marketing company.  We're both
in our 50's and facing the very real possibility of NEVER being able to
retire.  We had nothing saved, no pension and knew we couldn't trust the
social security system.  We also knew that only 3% of the people who
"try" network marketing actually succeed.  Experience had taught us that
the word "try" was a cop-out!  You either commit to giving it your all
or you don't bother.  We gave it our all and we're already
half-retired.  (Bill quit his retail job just two weeks ago and Erika
will be closing her accounting business at the end of this year.)  Our
grandaughter just loves having her Pops around when she's here on
weekends.

Are you willing to at least learn the details of how we can help you
achieve personal and financial freedom just like we're doing?  If you
are, just "Reply" to this message with a valid e-mail address.  We'll get right back to you with
all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Whatever you decide to do, may your life always be filled with enough
time to spend with those you love the most.

Bill and Erika
