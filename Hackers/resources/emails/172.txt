Subject: YOU ARE INVITED TO.......


Suppose there was a way to:

     Pay off a 30 year Mortgage in much less time
     Pay off all your credit card debt,
     Pay off all your debts without a bankruptcy,
     Pay off student loans,
     Pay off business loans,
     Pay off judgments,
     Pay off child support,
     Pay off IRS liens,
     Pay off property tax liens,
     Pay rents and leases,
     Pay off phone, utility, etc., bills

Well, there is a way to pay off all these debts, and more, up to
$100,000...And you don't have to pay us back, EVER! 

I realize that it sounds too simple, but it is simple and straightforward, and
will cost you only the cost of a call to the (818) number to find out how to
get all your bills paid, WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO PAY US BACK.

For complete information, and to protect you and the club, please fill out the
below form and FAX to (818) 769-7358, together with an address verification
(driver's license, utility bill, deposit slip, etc.)  Then call (818)
763-1000, ext. 1950, for a phone appointment.

DO NOT call first!  They MUST have your fax in-hand before they can speak with
you, due to the proprietary nature of this information. 

(Please cut on dotted line, and fax only the portion below)
