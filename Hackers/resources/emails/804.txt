ABDUCTIONS!

Help prevent ABDUCTIONS with a satellite tracking device.

As a "LICENSEE" in a homebased business earn
substantial income various ways such as:
taking orders and etc. for tracking devices:
ExecTrak; SeniorTrak; BodyGuard;
Kidtrak; PetTrak; and KarTrak.

 Imagine parents, law enforcement, and other concerned
  parties being able to locate vulnerable children within
  seconds or minutes instead of within hours, days (in many
  cases never).

  Global Positioning Satellite technology has been around for
  years,  ever since the military started the whole thing.
  GlobalTrak International makes this amazing technology
  commercially available in the form of a line of products
  used for personal tracking.

  The cornerstone product KidTrak tracks lost or missing
  children anywhere on the surface of the earth within three
  to five yards, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

  SeniorTrak will locate lost or missing elderly individuals,
  nursing home patients, and alzheimer's patients.

  In the pet market, PetTrak is available.

  ExcuTrak is for executives and travelers wanting personal
  security when traveling.

  KarTrak, a product not wholly unlike Lojack, has the
  capacity to track and monitor your vehicle 24 hours a day
  and will notify you and law enforcement when your car is
  moved even several feet. There is no way car thieves will
  make much headway with this product.
