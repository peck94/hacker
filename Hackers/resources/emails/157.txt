Subject: Business Leaders Wanted

///This is a one time mailing.  If we reached you by mistake you need not respond as you will not be sent another message.///

We are seeking independent partners who are self-motivated,
highly-principled, open-minded entrepreneurs.  Such a profile might seem
demanding, but the rewards can be gigantic. We really need people with the 
confidence that, with the right vehicle, they be extraordinarily
successful.

We are not looking for investors.  This is a true ground-floor opportunity.  
It does not involve stocking products (cosmetic, nutritionals or any other).
This is the rare legitimate opportunity that people, not long form now, will 
look back to and lament that they missed.  

If you've already gotten all the time freedom and money you've always
wanted, this is probably not for you.  But if you haven't, how long are
you going to wait?

Email mail to duffypoo@mailexcite.com your PHONE NUMBER and the best
time to call.

Serious inquiries please.
