  **** WATER Is the Most Essential Element for Sustaining

         all life on this Planet  ****

************************************************************

     	REVELATION!!! ....THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH 

        FOR  A    HEALTHIER  -  WEALTHIER  -  HAPPIER YOU!!

************************************************************

 
  Did you know that the human body is approximately 70% Water?

  AND...that our Brains are 74% water....Our blood 83% water..

  our bones 22% water.....our kidneys, 82% water...and our
  
  muscles 75% water???


  In the human body, there are basically two (2) types of 

  biowater:  bound water and clustered water.  Clustered water

  is able to move freely through the cell walls and is necessary

  to transport nutrients, remove waste, and maintain proper
  
  communication between cells.  Bound water, on the other hand
  
  is water that becomes physically bound to other molecular

  structures and becomes trapped within the cells.



 
  When we are young, our bodies contain a high level of clustered

  water, and not much bound water.  However, as we age, bound

  water becomes more predominant and clustered water levels 

  decrease, hindering the effectiveness of literally thousands

  of metabolic functions and causing significant structural

  changes in our body's tissues.

  
  


  In 1992, Dr. Lee Lorenzen clarified the role that organized

  water plays in the aging process.  Many of the symptoms 

  associated with aging can be attributed to dehydration.  When

  people consume this newly created Clustered Water, their

  tissues undergo significant structural changes allowing for 

  an increase in metabolic efficiency.



  Fortunately for us, Dr. Lorenzen's breakthrough will allow us
  
  to actually restore clustered water levels in the body, and thus

  re-establish the cellular integrity we had when we were younger.



  Dr. Lorenzen has produced Clustered Water and stablized it so

  that it can now be consumed when added to distilled water.

  Persons drinking  Clustered Water have received help in

  correcting body aliments and experienced many physical

  improvements.  A patent ( U. S. Patent # 5711950) has
 
  been issued to Dr. Lorenzen on this template induction process
 
  and this wonderful product has just been made available
  
  to the public.

 
  A partial list of ailments that this product can help are

  listed below:


  #1.  Declines in blood sugar levels in diabetic patients

  #2.  Improvements in peripheral circulation in diabetics

  #3.  Declines in uric acid levels in patients with gout

  #4.  Improvements in liver patients

  #5.  Improved healing of gastroduodenal ulcers & prevention
       of recurrence

  #6.  Improvements in hypertension and hypotension

  #7.  Improvements in asthma, allergies, hayfever, & 
       atopic dermatitis

  #8.  Improvements in postgastroectomy diarrhea

  #9.  Improvements in postoperative bowel paralysis

 #10.  Improvements in serum bilirubin levels in newborn 
       infants.
