FSGI Corporation (OTC BB:FSGI)

Primary Business:
FSGI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Standards Group, Inc.
(FSG) , provides auditing services to the credit union system at the most
competitive prices possible.  Credit union regulations stipulate that the
supervisory committee is required to ensure an audit is performed annually,
but regulations do not require that a CPA firm performs this audit.  FSG is
not a CPA firm, and performs non-certified, comprehensive annual audits that
meet all credit union regulation requirements. Since a CPA firm does not
perform the audit, the fees are much more competitive than most CPA firms.

Market Overview:
As a credit union grows in size and complexity, and management takes on
increased responsibilities,  internal audits functions as a control designed
to assist management in ensuring that the credit union is able to accomplish
its goals and objectives.  FSG’s qualified loan auditors/reviewers are
trained to review credit loan policies and help management monitor this
critical area. FSG designs audits to focus on the most common types of
embezzlements committed in credit unions and to identify them at an early
stage.

Investment Highlights:
On July 31, 1998 FSGI  began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the
symbol  FSGI
FSG currently services approximately 500 credit unions.
Clients range in asset size from approximately $500,000 to over
$175,000,000.
FSG anticipates having over 1,000 credit union clients within 18 months and
2,000 within 36 months
FSG is the largest and only public credit union auditing company in the
United States.

Recent Developments:
--On September 8, 1998 FSGI announced  that Financial Standards Group (FSG)
opened its eighth office in Metairie, Louisiana.  According to Jason Lents,
President/CEO, ‘We have been developing a considerable audit client base in
Louisiana during the past 12 months and it is now time to open an office in
order to better serve those credit unions.  At the present time, FSG audits
approximately 30 credit unions out of approximately 300, in Louisiana.  With
the opening of the office, we believe FSG will increase to approximately 150
audits in Louisiana within the next 12-18 months.  FSG began auditing in
Mississippi in April 1997 and in slightly more than 16 months, we now audit
110 of the approximately 135 credit unions in the state of Mississippi.”
--On September 14, 1998 FSGI announced that Michael Santone has been named
as Director of  Auditing of Financial Standards Group (FSG).  According to
Jason Lents, President/CEO, “We are extremely pleased to have Mike join the
FSG team.  Mike is a CPA with three years of credit union auditing
experience with a national CPA firm that audits only credit unions.  In
addition, Mike has worked as a controller for a federal credit union with
assets of approximately $400 Million.”
