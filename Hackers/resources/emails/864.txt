Subject: You may be able to use this....

Hi...,

Could your computer use a lift?
I found these two free downloads on the Internet and I thought
you might be able to use them.  One will increase the power of your
computer's CPU up to 75% allowing you to process information faster.
The other will allow you to download Web Pages on the Internet a lot
faster.  I hope these help you.

A Lesson to Learn....  (choices)

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate.  He was always in a good mood, 
and always had something positive to say.  When someone would ask him
how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were doing any better, I would
be twins!"

Always happy, always upbeat, he was a natural motivator who seemed to draw
people to himself like a magnet.  Nothing ever seemed to bother this guy.
If a person came to him with a complaint, he would find something positive
to say about the situation and before you knew it, the complainer would 
leave with a smile and a different outlook.

Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry
and I asked him,...."Look, I just don't get it.  Nobody can be in a good
mood and positive all the time.  How do you do it?"  Jerry replied, "Each
morning I wake up and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today.  
You can choose to be in a good mood, or you can choose to be in a bad mood.
I choose to be in a good mood.  No matter what happens to me throughout
my day, I can choose to look at the negative or to find the positive.  
I choose to find the positive.  I can choose to be happy, or I can choose
to be sad.  I choose to be happy."

"Yeah Right, it's not that easy," I protested.  "Yes it is," Jerry said.
"Life is all about choices.  When you cut away all of the junk, every 
situation is a choice.  You choose how you react to situations.  You choose
how people will effect your mood.  You choose to be in a good mood or a bad
mood.  The bottom line is:  It's your choice how you live life."

Several years later, Jerry was involved in a terrible accident.
Jerry worked in a restaurant business, and one night while closing up, he
mistakenly left the back door open and was held up at gunpoint by three 
armed robbers.  While trying to open the safe, his hand, shaking from
nervousness, slipped off the combination.  The robbers panicked and shot him.
Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly, and rushed to the local trauma
center.  After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was
released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body.

I saw Jerry about six months after the accident and when I asked him how
he was doing, he replied, "If I were any better, I'd be twins."  Perhaps,
it was none of my business, but I just had to ask what had gone through his
mind as the robbery took place.  "The first thing that went through my mind
was that I should have locked the back door," Jerry replied.  "Then, as I 
lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices;  I could choose to 
live or I could choose to die.  I chose to live.  "Weren't you scared?" I 
asked.  Jerry continued, "The paramedics were great.  They kept telling me
that I was going to be fine.  But when they wheeled me into the ER, and I
saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.  In their eyes, I could read, 'He's a deadman.'  I knew I had to 
take action."

"What did you do", I asked.  "Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting
questions at me."  said Jerry. "She asked me if I was allergic to anything.
'Yes I replied.'  The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited
for my reply.  I took a deep breath and yelled, "To Bullets!"  Over their
laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live, operate on me as if I am
alive, not dead'."

Jerry lived thanks to the skills of his doctors, but also because of his
amazing attitude.  I learned from him that every day we have the choice
to live fully.  We control our joy, our pain, our suffering and our 
pleasure in life.  Life is a most precious gift which we have been given,
but how we live, no matter what our circumstance or status, or condition,
is our choice.  Right now, right this moment, at this very instance, make
a choice how you choose to live this day.

You now have two choices......
	1.  You can choose to delete this long message.
		                   or
	2.  You can choose to forward this message to someone you really
	     care about.  (Or to anyone else whose computer or Spirits may
	     need a LIFT).
