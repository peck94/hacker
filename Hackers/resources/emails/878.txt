We've just re-released HyperTerminal Private Edition 4.0, and 
you're welcome to download it FREE. (We're notifying you because 
you downloaded a previous version. If you want to remove yourself 
from our mailing list, see the end of this message.)

You may be thinking, "Re-released! What the heck does that mean?"

More than 100,000 people downloaded HyperTerminal Private Edition 
4.0 since its release two months ago. With so many people using it, 
and so many new features, it's not surprising a few bugs would turn 
up. We've responded quickly, and created a new version of 
HyperTerminal Private Edition 4.0 that you can download today!

HyperTerminal Private Edition 4.0 introduced these new features:

 * Now you can define key macros to send passwords, user IDs or
   often-used host commands with one keystroke
 * Set terminal screen size (rows and columns); now also supports
   telnet NAWS feature for telnet sites with variable screen size
 * Define the colors used by the terminal screen
 * Full color support when emulating VT100 terminals
 * Pass-through printing lets host systems control your printer
 * Ability to exit the program automatically when you log off
 * Updated entries for BBSs and telnet sites that you can call
 * Adopts Windows new "flat" toolbar style
 * Use Windows sounds (WAV and audio files) instead of beeps
 * Bug fixes for improved use with all versions of Windows

You can install this new version right over any previous version 
without losing your settings.
