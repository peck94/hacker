Do you have an Inheritance tied up in Probate, or in a Trust?

Why wait for your money?

If you're an heir to an Estate, or a beneficiary of a Trust,
and you need an immediate cash advance -- let the professionals at Inheritance Funding Co. (IFC) give you a portion of the money you're waiting for -- now.

As you know, probate is a slow process.  In most cases it is
at least a year before an estate reaches final distribution.

Why not utilize this extraordinary frozen asset right now,
when you need it most -- to pay off nagging debts or medical bills,
fix a vehicle, get up to date on your mortgage, or simply make that important purchase you've been putting off since last Christmas…

Not only is IFC the nation's oldest, most widely recognized provider of advances to heirs and beneficiaries -- we are the only company in America solely and exclusively focused on providing cash to heirs nationwide.

No other financial institution can match our experience or our service.

Our Estate Transactions are safe, easy and fast.

Credit status is not a problem.

No monthly payments.

No points.

No increased debt.

No kidding.

Just plain old cash when you need it.

And by the way, with the upcoming Holidays in mind, IFC is currently giving away a $250.00 rebate coupon to heirs and beneficiaries who receive a cash advance by November 30th, 1998.

Call us today for a FREE Inheritance Info Booklet.  And while you're at it, ask to speak with an Estate or Trust specialist for a no-obligation Appraisal.

P.S.) If you're not an heir, but refer an heir to us -- you still get
the $250.00!
