                                                            HOMEOWNERS

                                              TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY

  Isn't it about time you took control of your money instead of letting it control you.  I will show you how to pay off your mortgage quicker AND put money in your pocket.  I will give you a simple step by step program that shows  you exactly when and how to pay off your mortgage quicker.  It will: 

  ***** IT WILL SAVE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
  ***** REDUCE THE TERM OF YOUR MORTGAGE
  ***** HELP YOU BUILD EQUITY FASTER
  ***** INCREASE YOUR NET WORTH

  I know you are saying you have heard that before.  But WAIT.  It is true you can refinance your mortgage and pay for refinancing costs, closing costs, title insurance, and even points.  That can cost you a couple thousand dollars right there.  They will also run a credit report and charge you for that too.  You don't need to.  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY.  DO IT YOURSELF.
There are also programs out there that you do not have to refinance and they charge between $200 - $500 dollars and charge you an extra service fee each month.  You don't need to. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY.  Do It YOURSELF.

How ??   You might ask.

 Easy:  I will send you a personalized and customized report of your mortgage situation detailing the differences between your regular mortgage and what I can save you in the mortgage savings program.  As a bonus I also include 2 extra ways to save even more.   Here look at what the program can save.  Take this example.

   Let's take a $100,000 mortgage at 8.75% for 30 years.
                                                                     Regular Mortgage      Mortgage Savings
           Equity in 10 years:                                  $11,094                     $32,601
           Payoff Period                                           30 years                     19 years 
           Interest Paid at Maturity                          $186,432                   $120,769

  That is $65,663 dollars in interest saved and 11 years in payments saved.  Your actual savings will very depending on your own mortgage.  But that is alot of money that you could have saved.

Let me show you how much you can save.  I will prepare a personalized and customized report detaling your mortgage and how much you will save with the mortgage savings program.
