Wall Street analysis from Harvard Equity Research has issued a STRONG
BUY recommendation on MKII stock.  William Rambo was quoted as
predicting a $2.50-$3.00 price near-term with "sustained momentum into
the $5.00 plus range by the 4th quarter of 1998".

Harvard Equity Research's recommendation AATK went
from $3 to $9.00 in ten trading days!

Harvard Equity Research is so confident of their projections that they
are offering their subscribers a money-back guarantee on their
subscription if MKII doesn't at least double within the next year.

To reiterate: an IMMEDIATE & STRONG BUY recommendation
on MKII.
