The announcement of this scientific breakthrough,
has set off a media fire-storm.  In the last few days,
the remarkable qualities of Androstenone Pheromones
have been featured in every major publication,
newspaper, national magazine, and television magazine.
From 20/20, Hard Copy, and Dateline NBC, to the N.Y.
Times, and the American Journal of Modern Medicine.

Several independent research institutes have concluded
studies on the benefits of Androstenone (You may have
heard about the most recent study on CNN.)
