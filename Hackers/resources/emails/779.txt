"I can smell a good deal when it tastes right" - Yogi Berra --

"I send out 25,000 emails every day and get an avg. of 8 sales
on my $69.95 item.  Sure I'm happy with that!  And your lists
are the best I've ever used to date.  
--Lindsay Hanniford, Vancouver, B.C. --

"I'm a home based entrepreneur so I can't use more than several
million email names every couple of months...so why pay for
them - they just become stale!  I got a chance to try out bulk 
email with your list for very little risk and I'm very pleased
with what I paid for!" -- Daniel McNeil, Arlington, Texas --

-- "I was soooooo frustrated collecting my own email addresses
from the net using those extraction programs - ugh #%@7&% - but
I wasn't willing to spend another $ 219 for email names. I've had
excellent results with your names and almost no removes. Cool! 
-- Elena Chicciotti, Canberra, Australia -- 

-- "Your list continues to be a great deal at a great price.
It's nice to get what you pay for...rare to get more than you
pay for as in this case. Thanks Much!
 -- Raymond and Fiona Mollins, Budd Lake, NJ --
