    Mega Pro 32vb5. This little utility allows you to count, dedupe, randomize, seed, remove, separate, sample, Compare, and much more. It's the only 32bit program that can do all that in one program. It with the Rapid Fire Mailer is all the software you need to do bulk mailing. It's 32bit
power and speed, is all you need. It's Windows95 and Windows N.T.40 Compatible.


    RAPID FIRE MAIL SERVER!  Rapid Fire is the best software that we know of that transforms your computer into a mail server.  When you send mail using Rapid Fire, you use absolutely no resources from your ISP's mail server. This is very important for a number of reasons.  First of all, chances are, your ISP does not allow bulk mailing. They simply don't have the resources to handle bulk e-mail. So, there is really only one way for an ISP to deal with the bulk mailer overloading there system, and that is to cancel there account indefinitely. UNTIL NOW! Rapid Fire solves this problem because Rapid Fire DOES NOT upload mail to your ISP's mail server.  Instead it transforms your computer into a mailer server, and any mail you send goes directly from your computer into your recipients mailbox!  Therefore, you don't have to worry about abusing your ISP's mail server.  Your mail completely bypasses it and you use only your computers resources.  This will help you stay in good grace!
!
s with you ISP! However, this is only one of the many features of the Rapid Fire mail server.  Your Rapid Fire mail server also verifies all addresses that you send.  Since your software communicates with each individual address, it knows which addresses are valid and which ones are not.  When it discovers an invalid address it immediately discards it into a "bad send file"  This practically eliminates undeliverables. 

       Your mail server is also extremely fast!  First of all, since you will be placing your recipients mail directly into their mail box,  it will arrive instantaneously!  Unlike having to wait your turn on a bogged down mail server, which could take hours or days, your message is delivered immediately.  Secondly, your mail server will automatically thread through multiple servers simultaneously to deliver your mail.  What this means is, your modem opens multiple connections, this is possible due to the multi-tasking environment of Windows95.  It is similar to opening up one program several times.  This utilizes the full
bandwidth of your modem and allows you to achieve sending speeds of over 80,000 per hour.  Realize, there are many programs out there that  claim to send at speeds of over 250,000 messages per hour.  I have used these programs and the fastest I have ever sent is  125,000 per hour.  However, is it REALLY sending that fast?  No! Is it uploading messages to the server that fast?  Yes. Unfortunately, many times your ISP sets filters to simply recognize this type of activity and deletes this mail as fast as it is uploaded. Then you get an unpleasant phone call informing you that your service has been cut off.  Furthermore, these programs use blind carbon copy (bcc) to achieve their speed.  What the program does is attaches a single recipient name to groups up to 100 messages at a time.  If one address is undeliverable, some servers will throw away the whole batch.  So, how many messages did you really get out?  You never know. With your Rapid Fire Mail Server every valid e-mail add!
!
ress get delivered!

   Other features include, sending messages in html code, personalizing letters, randomizing your headers, to block any filter a receiving ISP may set, the ability to save projects and merging capabilities within the program. Your going to like this Mailer!
