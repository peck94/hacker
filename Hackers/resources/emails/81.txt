organizations based in the United States and virtually none in Canada?        
        
Well, welcome to:        
        
*********************************        
Consumer Direct Online        
*********************************        
        
We're looking for people who want (A) want out of or protection from the        
rat race (B) want a RISK-FREE/LOW COST way to make some extra money and        
(C) a pre-built downline full of North Americans who truly and genuinely        
want a change in their lives.        
        
This is TEAMWORK! TOGETHER EVERYONE ACHIEVES MORE!        
        
We are announcing today, the creation of a team that will        
put HUNDREDS of NORTH AMERICANS in a position where they receive a        
residual income that goes on auto-pilot.        
        
There are 155 positions available.         
        
YOU ARE AMONG THE FIRST GROUP OF 100 PEOPLE RECEIVING THIS MESSAGE AND YOU MAY EVEN GET ONE OF THE FIRST LEVEL POSITIONS         
IF YOU RESPOND QUICK ENOUGH.        
        
Your background, education or present circumstances don't matter because        
EVERYONE can do this business!        
        
We're looking for 155 people to ESTABLISH OUR TEAM and WE ONLY WANT        
A COMMITMENT IN PRINCIPLE AT THE MOMENT!        
        
Once we have ALL 155 names, we will share full and specific details with        
you of this exciting program which has the following features:        
        
NO LARGE INVESTMENT        
NO INVENTORY        
NO NEED TO DELIVER PRODUCTS        
NO REPEAT PRESENTATIONS        
NO PRESSURING CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE        
NO BILLINGS OR COLLECTIONS        
NO COMPLICATED PAPERWORK        
and most important        
NO RISK!        
        
/////////////////////////////        
This is a BUYING CLUB - your commitment is not to SELL product - it is        
simply to switch stores and purchase every day products such as shampoo,        
conditioner, deodorant, laundry detergent, vitamins, etc. from one        
source. YOU WILL NOT SPEND MORE MONEY THAN YOU ARE SPENDING ALREADY!!!!        
/////////////////////////////        
        
The company we have selected can boast the following impressive        
statistics:        
        
80% of all people who see a PROPER presentation enroll as CUSTOMERS        
(Customers is the key word here - no-one is a salesperson or a        
distributor)        
94% of all people who have enrolled since 1984 have stayed as customers.        
98% of all customers order product EACH AND EVERY MONTH!         
14 years in business in Canada and the United States.        
The president of the company is the former head of IBM!        
$580 MILLION CDN in customer purchases last year ($400 Million US)        
        
Once we have put all 155 team members in place, we        
will convene a conference call and walk EVERYONE through this exciting        
program.        
        
The company's track record is impressive and        
so is their COMPENSATION PLAN which includes MASSIVE, I mean MASSIVE        
bonuses for individuals with groups of 48 or more!  That's right! just        
48 or more!        
        
To reserve your position on our Consumer Direct Online Team, simply send a        
reply e-mail to me at webmaster@globaltekgrp.com and your position will        
be automatically locked in.        
        
•••••••••••••••••••••••        
IMPORTANT        
•••••••••••••••••••••••         
        
THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO JOIN THE PROGRAM!        
        
IT MEANS THAT ONCE WE TRIGGER THE CALL TO ENROLL, (after the conference        
call) YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR POSITION. THOSE        
WHO DROP OUT (AND WE RECOGNIZE THERE WILL BE A FEW) WILL SEE THE PEOPLE        
BELOW THEM ROLL-UP INTO THEIR POSITIONS.        
        
The start-up cost is $29. US/ $39 CDN. and will only be due when we are ready to        
ENROLL EVERYONE AS A GROUP so EVERYONE starts making money from DAY ONE!        
        
The strategy is to enroll at the beginning of the month (perhaps May        
1st , EH!) which also means NO-ONE has to place a product        
order (household items you use every day such as shampoo, soap, laundry        
detergent, etc) until the end of the month.        
        
********************        
NOTIFICATION        
********************        
        
As a member of Consumer Direct Online, I will inform you of        
your position in the matrix within 24 hours of receiving your e-mail.        
        
If you would like a presentation, we can do it via the net and by phone,        
but you need to be locked in to the Consumer Direct Online first - the        
concept of a pre-built downline is one you have to embrace - the        
company, the products, and the compensation plan will keep you there!        
        
********************        
THE BOTTOM LINE        
********************        
        
Think about those statitics I quote earlier in this message. 80% of        
people who see a PROPER presentation sponsor in as customers.        
        
The bottom line is this - it is documented in dozens of reports and        
periodicals that MORE THAN 95% OF people HATE SELLING. Yet, those some        
people LOVE the idea of residual income. That's why this programs works!        
Lots of residual income and NO SELLING.        
        
Think of all the people who say no to home businesses because they        
didn't want to sell or they didn't have time.  This program eliminates        
those objections.         
        
When you see what your income potential is with just a handful of people        
in your organization, you're going to say - LET'S GET MOVIN'!        
        
So, enough with the preliminaries - this opportunity is NOT A STARTUP        
and its risk free - so is joining Consumer Direct Online - just        
e-mail your reply to me with "LOCK ME IN" in the subject heading and        
you'll get your position. This will all be done sequentially and it is        
100% voluntary.        
        
The power of downline-building is AWESOME.        
        
P.S. You'll notice I held back the name of the company (IT'S NOT AMWAY)        
because it is my firm belief that when you see the full details of their        
incredible pay plan you will understand the power of this program,        
especially for experienced networkers!        
        
P.S. If you have more than one name to contribute, feel free to do so.        
However, only one position per household is permitted - friends and        
associates are welcome - THE MORE THE MERRIER. Names contributed by you        
will go into your organization. Thank you.
