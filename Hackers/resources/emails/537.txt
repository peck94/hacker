"Seven Deadly Diseases Plague Mankind"
 

Dear friend,
 
  I am writing to you today because I 
am a little concerned. About a year or 
so ago, I began to notice something 
that bothered me. I began to notice 
that every year more and more people 
were dying from what I later identified 
and named 

" The Seven Deadly Diseases of Mankind".
 
  Everyday my television would declare 
such disturbing things as

"death rates up 23% this year", " over 
one million will suffer and die this year 
from...."
 
 You get the point.

To be honest with you, I became frightened! 
I am just an average guy with an average 
life. But I do enjoy my life and I do love 
my family.

How do I know that they won't become sick, 
or, even worse...die from one of these diseases.

How could I call myself a "good husband and 
father" and not try to protect my family.
  
 Sure, I could pretend that there wasn't a 
risk, pretend that nothing could ever happen 
to me or my family.

But why take the chance?
 
So I decided to do everything I could to 
protect myself and my family.

I started reading everything I could get 
my hands on about health. I tried every health 
product on the shelf and bought into every 
health fad that came down the pipe.
 
But I still wasn't satisfied!

During my one man "crusade for life", 
I built a profile, a rap sheet of sorts, 
on the top seven diseases that kill more 
people than anything else on earth and what 
can be done to prevent them.
 
I believe in the phrase "know thy enemy"!

I believe that before you can fight something, 
you MUST know how it lives and operates.

Most people think that they know enough to 
"get by'! But in this case, that's not enough.

 
Why should we take our lives for granted?

If you don't mind, please take a brief moment 
and see if you are prepared! 

Below are a few questions that will serve as 
an indicator. This will be well worth the time.....

* What disease will take the lives of over 
800,000 Americans this year alone, and what 
can be done to stop it?

*What silent killer affects over 500,000 
Americans, goes completely unnoticed, and 
what you can do to fight it?

*What disease will cause you to lose 
feeling in your feet, and then cause you 
to lose your feet? How can it be stopped?

 If you know the answers to the above questions, 
you are in good shape. If not, in my opinion, 
you could be risking your health. 

Don't be like millions of others and pretend 
that your body is an unpenetrable
fortress. It isn't, my friend. 
 
 I want to share the information that 
I have learned with you. 

 I want to tell you what I know about 
these diseases and what I'm doing to stop 
them from taking away all that I hold dear.
 
Am I saying that I have all of the answers? 
Of course not! I wish I did!

 But what I am saying is that we only have 
one life to live, so why take chances with 
something that could possibly be prevented? 

Wouldn't it be worth knowing that at least 
you did your best in taking care of you and
your family's health?

  So please, do yourself and those you love 
a favor. Go right now, pick up the phone and 
call me at

1-888-573-9813


 I really believe this will make a tremendous 
difference in your life!

I sincerely thank you for your precious time, 
dear friend. And I wish you the best of health!
