Subject: VERY  VERY  IMPORTANT !


Dear Friend:

This is an extremely IMPORTANT announcement for you!

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
                       IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
                       IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
                       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                       Your Future May Depend on it!!!
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

BUT FIRST, please read the following Editorial Excerpts from some 
important publications in the United States: 


New York Times:   "In concluding our review of financial organizxations
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''        to effect change in the 90's, special attention should
be called to 'World Currency Cartel' organization based in California. The
members of this organization are amassing hundreds of millions of dollars
in the currency market using a very LEGAL method which has NEVER
been divulged to the general public. While their purpose is not yet known,
their presence has most certainly been felt".

NBC Nightly News:   "Members of the World Currency Cartel organization,
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''        who always keep Low Profile of themselves, are some
of the most powerful and wealthiest people in this hemisphere".

More Excerpts later, but first let us give you this "Important Announcement":
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
We are glad to announce that for the very first time, the World Currency
Cartel organization will instruct a LIMITED number of people worldwide on
HOW TO CONVERT $25 INTO ONE HUNDRED OF LEGAL CURRENCY.

We will transact the first conversion for you, after that you can quickly and
easily do this on your own hundreds or even thousands of times each and
every month. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS "SECRET FLAW" !
                     ==================================

It is even more explosive than we have yet disclosed. While currency does
fluctuates daily, we can show you HOW TO CONVERT $99 INTO $580 as
many times as you want. That means, you will be able to CONVERT $99
American Legal Currency Dollars for $580 OF THE SAME. You can do this
as many times as you wish, every day, every week, every month. All very
LEGALLY and effortlessly!

It only takes about 5 to 10 minutes each time you do this. You can do this
from your home, your office or even while travelling. All you need is an access
to a phone line and an address. Best of all, you can do this from ANY CITY
ON THIS EARTH!!!

Again, we must reiterate, anyone can do this and the source is Never-Ending.
For as long as the global financial community continues to use different curr-
encies with varying exchange rate, this "SECRET FLAW" will exist.
                                                           ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
As we have said earlier, we will do the first transaction for you and will also 
show you exactly how to do this on your own over and over again.

The amount of exchange you would do each time is entirely up to you.
Working just 2 to 10 hours a week, you can soon join the list of Millionaires
who do  this on a daily  basis  several  times  a day. The transaction is so 
simple that even a high school kid  can do it!

We at the World Currency Cartel organization would like to see a uniform
global currency backed by Gold. But, until then, we will allow a LIMITED
number of individuals worldwide to share in the Unlimited Profits provided
for by the world currency differentials.

We will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you to do so. We 
can say  however,  that  our  parent  organization  Diamond  International
benefits greatly by the knowledge being shared as we ourselves alongwith
YOU benefit likewise. Your main concern surely will be, how you will benefit.

As soon as you become a member, you can start making transanctions
from your home, office, by telephone or through the mail  and even while
travelling. As said earlier, we will do the first transanction for you and 
will show you exactly how to do this on your own over and over again.

No one can stop you from earning hundreds of thousands and even millions
of dollars each year for as long as this "SECRET FLAW" exists.
                                                       ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Don't  believe us, experience it for yourself!
================================       Unlike anyone else, we will
assure you a great financial freedom and you will add to our quickly growing
base of supporters and you may join the list of Millionaires being created 
using the "SECRET FLAW" in the world currency market.

Here are some more Editorial Excerpts:

Wall Street :          "A discreet group of Americans, operating under the guise
                             of World Currency Cartel have recently begun making
rumbles in the world finance market. While at this time, their game is not
completely known, they certainly be watched by those making major moves
in the currency contracts".

Financial Week :    "Watch them, monitor them, extract their knowledge
                             and try to become one of them. That is the soundest 
financial advice we could give to someone".

National Business Weekly :  "While this reporter has been left in the cold 
                                          as to its method of operation, we have been
able to confirm that World Currency Cartel and its members are literally 
amassing a great furtune overnight".
