Hi there!

Buzz and I are hot on the trail of our latest case but we're so glad you
sent us this e-mail.
The K-9000 is running great and Commander Lou has got us working hard to
solve all of your pet questions.  We love all the questions and suggestions
you're sending in to us and we've passed them on to Commander Lou!!  No case
is too big, too small, or too hairy!
So remember ... who's on the case?  PET SQUAD!

Bye for now!

Katie & Buzz
