Subject: PRESIDENT TO GO.....Starr's Shock R

Excerpt from the K.Starr's Independent Counsel Report............

.....According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her early that afternoon.
It was the first time he had called her at home. In her recollection: "I asked him
what he was doing and he said he was going to be going into the office soon.
I said, oh, do you want some company? And he said, oh, that would be great."
Ms. Lewinsky went to her office, and the President called to arrange their
rendezvous: 

[W]e made an arrangement that . . . he would have the door to his office open,
and I would pass by the office with some papers and then . . . he would sort of
stop me and invite me in. So, that was exactly what happened. I passed by and
that was actually when I saw [Secret Service Uniformed Officer] Lew Fox who
was on duty outside the Oval Office, and stopped and spoke with Lew for a few
minutes, and then the President came out and said, oh, hey, Monica . . . come
on in . . . . And so we spoke for about 10 minutes in the [Oval] office. We sat on
the sofas. Then we went into the back study and we were intimate in the bathroom.

Ms. Lewinsky testified that during this bathroom encounter, she and the President
kissed, and he touched her bare breasts with his hands and his mouth. The President
 "was talking about performing oral sex on me, bringing me to orgasm" according to Ms. Lewinsky. But she stopped him because she was menstruating and he did not.(209) Ms. Lewinsky did perform oral sex on him.(210) 

Afterward, she and the President moved to the Oval Office and talked. According to Ms. Lewinsky: "[H]e was chewing on a cigar. And then he had the cigar in his hand and he
was kind of looking at the cigar in . . . sort of a naughty way. And so . . . I looked at the
cigar and I looked at him and I said, we can do that, too, some time.".......................
