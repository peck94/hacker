Dear Internet User, 

You are receiving this offer because you are a valued Netscape customer. 
I'm writing to tell you about a special opportunity you won't want to 
miss.  It's a new free service -- actually a whole collection 
of services -- that will make your time on the Internet easier, more 
productive and more effective than ever before. 

It's called NETCENTER, and it lets you take charge of your Internet 
experience.  Best of all, becoming a member of Netcenter 
is absolutely FREE.  It's no wonder that in the few short months since 
its launch, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY JOINED, 
and why industry analysts say that Netscape Netcenter "goes well 
beyond the services available from every other portal site."* 

Netcenter gives you the very best of what you need from the Internet, 
free.  For example, when you join you'll get AOL's popular Instant 
Messaging, allowing you to exchange messages instantly over the 
Internet with friends, family and coworkers.  You'll get free automatic 
Netscape software updates, too.  Plus permanent email, free subscriptions 
to over 135 popular online publications and 17 individual channels packed 
with invaluable information you can use in every aspect of 
your life and work.  Of course, you have your own individually 
customized Home Page called My Netscape, with everything 
you want at your fingertips the instant you need it. 

There's a lot more you'll get with your free Netcenter membership -- 
from Net Search to Classifieds to our comprehensive 
Web Directory to What's New, What's Cool and complete Yellow and White 
Pages. Plus lively discussion groups and the best web content you can find 
anywhere.  You can even get Netcenter in 17 international versions! 
And you'll be glad to know that navigating the Internet as a Netcenter 
member is both EASY and FUN! 

Many of our popular services, like Webmail and Instant Messages, are 
available only to registered Netcenter members, so you'll want to take 
advantage of this opportunity while you have the chance. 

Why not join now and start enjoying all these free services and more? We 
look forward to welcoming you to the Netcenter family! 

Click here and you're in!
