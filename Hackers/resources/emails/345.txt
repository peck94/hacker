Free Government Grants 

For complete info go to:

The US Government sets aside Billions of dollars each year in the form 
of grants and loans for entrepreneurs and the American public. Your tax 
dollars are not all spent by the Defense Department. A large percentage 
of your tax dollars are set up for domestic assistance to help individuals,
entrepreneurs and businesses create jobs whether the company is large
or small. Steven Jobs received government help with his company Apple
Computers, Donald Trump,Ross Perot , Lee Iaccoca are just to name 
a few of the individuals who used this program to start billion dollar 
corporations.

Each year the government gives out hundreds of millions of dollars to 
companies,individuals and entrepreneurs, homemakers and the likes. 
Currently, less than 2% of the population applies for grants and loans 
while a large percentage around 4 Billion remains unclaimed when it 
could help an entrepreneur, company or someone in need. Most Americans 
do not know these programs exist for their benefit. The government wants 
you to succeed in hopes of stimulating the economy. Take a look at some 
of the programs available.

Direct Grants to $800,000 Direct Loans to $2,200,000. Over 300 grants 
for business and loans that are easier to obtain than conventional 
loans. All grants and some loans require no credit check and no 
collateral because you are actually borrowing your tax dollars set aside 
for business start-up and development. You live in the greatest country 
in the world "Only in America" You hear the term spoken but without 
comprehension. More immigrants call for assistance than US citizen,s 
they see the opportunity and if not first successful they try back when 
they become citizen,s. Are they successful? Eventually.

The government means business ,to help you they have hired over 1500 
professionals to help you if only you would call. The area of expertise 
falls under marketing, consultation,import,export and anything 
pertaining to business that might help you succeed.This could mean the 
difference in success or failure of your business. The business endeavor 
does not matter the government has the money and an expert to help you 
whether you are in farming,real estate, retail,daycare or any legal 
money making opportunity.

If you are a tax paying citizen you owe it to yourself to take a look at 
these programs immediately.
