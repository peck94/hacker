AUDIOBOOK -- How Stella Got Her Groove Back, by Terry McMillan
This unabridged Penguin Audiobook has recently been made into a movie and is
playing across the nation to rave reviews.  Stella has it all, except a man,
something she's convinced she's got no use for anyway.  A vacation to Jamaica
and a sexy man half her age give her second thoughts.  This smart, funny novel
from the author of Waiting to Exhale will have you laughing out loud.

MUSIC -- The Swingsters, "Clear the Road"
The Swingsters mixes music from New Orleans and the Caribbean with charm
and warmth of the same kind as is brought to the cold North by the Gulf
Stream. Formed in Sweden in 1995 from their predecessors Sumpens
Swingsters, this seven-piece band continues to explore the roots of
jazz, rhythm n' blues, and Caribbean music.
