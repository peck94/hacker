home.  American Capital<B> </B>is constantly working with other lenders 
throughout the U.S. to provide you with the best interest rate 
possible.  We have a number of different companies that we work 
with and this is at <FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3><B>NO</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B> cost to you <FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3><B>EVER</B>.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>  We are

	Are you aware that banks throughout the United States are 
pressuring Congress that people in a high tax bracket can only 
file Chapter 13 so that the banks have some kind of recourse.  

	Let me assure you these statistics are not to scare you 
but rather to inform you that you may or may not be alone.  

	The goal of American Capital is to provide homeowners 
with lenders that fit your needs.  We can provide you with 
lenders that will loan you up to <FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3><B>125%</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B> of the value of your 
home and there is <FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3><B>NO</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B> equity needed..  In any case there 
are<FONT COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3> <B>NO upfront fees or advances of ANY KIND on your part</B>.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3> 
 What do you have to lose, why not give it a shot and see if you 
can better your situation.
