Aloha,
Happy Easter and thank you for opening our letter. HAWAII NANI is 
pleased to  offer you unique, made-in-Hawaii, gift baskets that embody 
the spirit of Aloha and are most appropriate gifts to surprise and 
delight your friends and loved ones on Easter and other special 
occasions. May we suggest: 
          
ISLAND COFFEE BASKET for $19.95. In a hand woven keepsake palm-frond 
"lauhala" basket, two bags (4 oz ea) of fine grind, choice estate 
coffees from the upland plantations of Hawaii and a full bar-be-que 
apron of quality cotton in traditional Hawaiian Tapa design or our 
DELUXE COFFEE BASKET for $29.95. This large basket carries four cotton 
Tapa dinner napkins with a matching full apron and three bags of very 
special Hawaiiian grown, estate coffees. 

LOVELY MALIA  $19.95  A unique rag doll for little girls of all ages. 
Malia is a raggedy island girl in a colorful Muumuu, the beautiful 
dress of Hawaii. She's 20 inches long, has big, warm eyes and just wants to 
be hugged. Malia owns no cars or appliances but she comes in her own 
"lauhala" travelling basket and brings Aloha. Lots of it.
