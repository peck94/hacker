E-Mail Pro Version 4.0

THERE ARE MYRIAD'S of benefits that people seek from any
given service or product. When people are seeking for Mass
E-mail software, an important benefit to search for gets forgotten.
The question, "How will I process remove requests, purge
duplicates, and delete undeliverables?" This question, is normally
never addressed when seeking for the "right" software. Probably
because these questions don't need to be addressed until after
everything has been purchased, and you have done your first
"blast" of mailings. It's then that the words, removal requests,
duplicates and undeliverable have a whole new definition.

Although the software has been overlooked, doesn't make it not
important. In fact it shares just as much importance, if not more to
the e-mailing campaign. Remember, the first lesson in mass
e-mailing is "netiquette", or Internet Etiquette. For this to happen,
when someone wishes to be removed from your mailing list,
they're not asking twice!

Our solution, is "E-mailpro Version 4.0".

Here's how easily it works...

This one of a kind software program is designed to manage and
clean up any list of e-mail addresses. It will purge duplicates,
manage removes and delete undeliverables. It will also
separate and categorize your list of e-mail addresses by domain
names.

It does this by creating a database of all of your e-mail addresses,
sorted by user defined categories, and exports them to a mailing
list text file. While the e-mail addresses are being filtered through
the database, it is seeking for duplicates, removes, and/or
undeliverable e-mail addresses, and prohibiting them from
entering the database.

The E-mail Pro Version 4.0 Bulk E-mail Loader also imports
simple text files that anyone can download from AOL,
CompuServe, the Internet, etc...These text files contain classified
ads, forum messages, or data from the member directory. Each
of these files are filled with e-mail addresses.

The E-mail Pro Version 4.0 Instruction Manual will teach you, step
by step, how to download the right files, how to strip the
addresses, and compile them into a mailing list file.
