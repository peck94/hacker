Subject: Your web site is missing Meta Tags

We've just scanned your web site, and found that
http://www.qcctech.com
is missing Meta Tags.

Meta Tags are used by the biggest search engines to index
web sites.  Without them, your site is probably not indexed
with the key words and description needed for people to find it.

Millions of viewers daily use these facilities to find the products
and services they are looking for.  But if your site is not properly
listed, no one one will see it.

Listings on most of these services are free.  However, preparing your
site with Meta Tags and locating and filling out the forms required to
get a listing can take several days, and most people just don't have the
time to do it.

That is why we offer a web site promotion service.

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

First, we will download your home page, add Meta Tags according to
the key words and description you have provided, and email it back to
you for uploading to your web site.  (Meta Tags are invisible, and will not
affect the way your site looks).  Then we will submit your site to 50
indexes and search engines.  We will accept the return of this E-mail, with
the form below filled out, as an order.  We will bill you $165 upon
completion of the promotion.  Our terms are net 15 days from date of invoice.

HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?

Generally, we complete the submissions within two business days of
receiving your order.  It can take any individual search engine or
index up to three weeks to process your submission, although most are
much faster.

WHAT SEARCH ENGINES AND INDEXES ARE INCLUDED IN THE
PROMOTION?

The list changes from time to time.  This is our current list:

Alta Vista, Anzwers, AOL Netfind, BizCardz Business Directory, Bizlink,
BizWeb, Black Widow Search, Excite, Galaxy, HotBot, Infomak, Infoseek, 
InfoSpace, InterBis, Jayde Online Directory, Jumpcity, Jumper Hot Links, JumpLink, 
LinkMonster, Lycos, MangaSeeker, Manufacturers Information Network, 
Net Happenings, Net Announce, New Page List, New Riders WWW Yellow Pages, 
Northern Light, One World Plaza, PeekABoo, Planet Search, Power Crawler, 
QuestFinder, Scrub The Web, Seven Wonders, SiteFinder, SiteShack, Super Snooper, 
The YellowPages.com, TurnPike, Unlock: The Information Exchange, WebCrawler, 
WebVenture Hotlist, WhatUSeek, Where2Go, WhoWhere, World Announce Archive, 
Wow! Web Wonders!, YeeHaa!, Yellow Pages Superhighway, YelloWWWeb, Your Webscout, 
ZenFinder.


HOW WILL I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PROMOTED MY SITE?

When we have completed the promotion, we will send you an HTML
file as an attachment to your E-mail bill.  Save this file to your
disk, and view it through your Web browser.  It provides links to the
search engine we submitted your site to, plus any comments we received
from them when we did it.

ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES?

While we can't guarantee an increase in hits or a top position on
a search engine listing, we do guarantee that you will be satisfied with
our efforts on your behalf.  We do not require prepayment.
