                   EASY WAY TO FIND OUT ANYTHING 
                                  ABOUT ANYONE
                               ON THE INTERNET

Dear Web User:

DID YOU KNOW THAT:

With the Internet you can uncover EVERYTHING you ever wanted to know
about your EMPLOYEES, FRIENDS, RELATIVES, SPOUSE, NEIGHBORS, even your
own BOSS! You can check out ANYONE, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, right on the
internet...

It's no secret that the Internet is a GIGANTIC and POWERFUL SOURCE of
information, if you only know WHERE TO LOOK. 

But one of the best kept secrets in the world right now is probably the
amount of PERSONAL INFORMATION other people can find out about YOU and
others-- right on the INTERNET.

             *******************************************

                                       EXAMPLE!
                   INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT YOU

Right now,  with just your name and address, I can almost instantly find
out what you do for a living, name and age of your spouse and children, the
make and color of your car, the value of your home, (and probably how much
you paid for it), credit information, your employment records,  family
tree,  military records, which web sites you visit, etc., etc., etc. I can
even find that long forgotten drug bust you had in college.

AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING, but you get the idea.


             ******************************************

                             GOOD NEWS


The good news is that now YOU can find the same information, and more,
about ALMOST ANYONE.

We have compiled a  MASSIVE  COLLECTION of internet investigative tools
that will provide you with ...

      Over 350 immediately accessible internet sites and URLs to locate
people,
      credit records, social security, current or past employment,
      mail order purchases, addresses and phone numbers.
   
	It's mind boggling, the type and quantity of information at hand.

                  ***********************************  
         
                               YOUR COPY

Now, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN COPY  of this massive source of information.
Here are just a few of the things you can do with it:

  Put your mind at ease!

  those files.
  
                                AND

  else's INCOME.


Just IMAGINE being able to have all of this information at your fingertips
almost instantly!  Think of the MANY USES.
