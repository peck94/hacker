Dear Fellow Entrepreneur:

Ok, you've got a product or service to sell. You've set up a beautiful
website, submitted it to all the search engines and your fingers are
numb from endless posting to classified and free-4-all sites. You did
everything right! Still, the prospects you expected to flood you with
orders just dribble in! I know, I've been there!

What if I told you that, in just a few short weeks, you would have to
hire extra personnel to handle a mountain of incoming orders! You'd be
interested, right? Now, what if I told you you can accomplish this
amazing feat in under one hour a day and that it would be ABSOLUTELY
FREE!?!

That's right, I said FREE and I meant it! What's more, you need not
fear "flames," "bombs," the loss of your ISP or an unfriendly knock at
the door in the early morning hours! Sound too good to be true? Read on!

In less than an hour a day, you can put your product or service in
front of as many as 3,200,000 potential customers! That's right, as
many as THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS exposed
to your offer and it's 100% FREE and TOTALLY LEGITIMATE!

Are you ready to learn this fool-proof, FREE system? Alright, let's
get started!

STEP 1

Make a copy of this letter!

STEP 2

Read the 5 advertisements at the end of this letter!

STEP 3

Remove the ad in the number 1 position and re-number the remaining ads
as 1 - 4!

STEP 4

Place an ad for your product, service or website AFTER (I'll explain
the importance of this in a moment) the number 4 ad and number it as
number 5.

STEP 5

Send the letter to 10 people (I'll tell you where to find them FREE) a
day, five days a week for two weeks. That's a total of 100 letters!

That's it! You're finished! Too simple you say? Let's look at the math!

The reason for sending 10 letters a day for 2 weeks is that you can
reasonably assume that, at least, 20% of those recieving your letter
are savvy enough business people to see the value of this FREE system!
That gives you 20 potential customers who will SEE YOUR ADVERTISEMENT!
Not impressed? Let's continue!

Each of those 20 recipients send out 100 letters and get a
20%participation. You now have 400 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS SEEING YOUR AD!

Each of those 400 people send out 100 letters and get 20%
participation.  You're now up to 8,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS SEEING YOUR
AD!

Each of those 8,000 send out 100 letters, get a 20% participation and
your ad is exposed to 160,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS!

Your advertisement is now in the number 1 position! If each of the
160,000 send out 100 letters and get only 20% participation, YOUR AD
IS SEEN BY 3,200,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS and YOU HAVE NOT SPENT ONE
RED CENT!!

Now, take a minute to catch your breath while I explain where to find
the 100 people to send your letter to at ABSOLUTELY NO COST and why
it's important to place your ad in the number 5 position! Actually,
we'll start with the positioning first!

You may ask yourself "why not shoot for the top and put my ad in the
number 1 position?" The answer is quite simple! Those who participate
in this POWERFUL and COMPLETELY FREE system will be doing the same
thing you should do, removing the number 1 ad and placing their ad in
the number 5 position. If you were to put your ad in the number one
spot, it will be gone after the first 
cycle! By placing it in the number 5 slot, Your ad won't be removed
until it is seen by as many as 3,200,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS! And
remember, this system is based on a REALISTIC participation rate of
ONLY 20%! A good chunk of the 80% who aren't serious enough about
their business and their future to participate will also be reading
YOUR AD! The total numbers are absolutely staggering!

So, where do you find the 100 people to send your letter to? Again,
it's quite simple and TOTALLY FREE! Just go to your favorite search
engine (Yahoo, Lycos, Alta Vista, etc.) classified section! There, you
will find THOUSANDS of commercial advertisements with email addresses!
These are professional marketers, like yourself who have placed these
ads with the same hopes of attracting customers you have! Talk about a
target market!

So, there you have it! And, of course, you don't have to stop at
sending your letter to only 100 people! If you wish (and can handle
the MASSIVE VOLUME this FREE system provides), you can send out more
letters as time permits and INCREASE YOUR PROFITS BEYOND YOUR WILDEST
DREAMS! This system simply CAN'T FAIL!

Please notice that I never promised a 100% participation rate. You and
I both know that would be totally unrealistic. That's why I use the
20% example. Your results may be more or less. It doesn't matter! If
you can accomplish even 5% participation, you're still miles ahead of
those timid, lazy souls who find themselves lost in a sea of
mediocrity. By the way, a 5% participation would still EXPOSE YOUR
PRODUCT OR SERVICE to OVER 300,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS! You simply
CAN'T LOSE!!

So, what are you waiting for? Read the advertiements below and start
sending your letter out NOW!
