Investors, The Market is booming!

Facing a new millennium, we enter into a booming entertainment
industry. "By some estimates,entertainment in its broadest 
definition will grow to a $40 billion annual business in California
alone. The entertainment industry, according to Fortune Magazine, has
increased its profit margins 100%.  
The Wall Street Journal states that of all industries, entertainment
ranks first in profits, with average earnings in excess of 300%.

The demand for better quality programming has led cable and
satellite operators to expand their channel capacities, with 
a goal of 500 channels or more by the year 2000. We have all
heard of channels such as The Discovery Channel, The Travel 
Channel, The History Channel, The Animal Channel, The Learning
Channel, The Family Channel, A&E, Bravo, National Geographic 
and more…  Viewers demand both educational and entertainment
programming.  This demand must be fulfilled, but there are 
simply not enough quality programs out there to fill the need 
for both the viewer's and the channel providers.  Re-runs and 
re-edits only go so far in attempting to satisfy an ever-growing
demand.

There exists a tremendous opportunity for you to capitalize 
on the rising tide of consumer demand, become a part owner of 
one of our documentary series for television. Projected return 
382% over 4 year period  plus Royalties!!!  Minimum investment
requirement 5K.
