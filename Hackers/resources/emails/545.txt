Subject: How To Create Original Products You Can Market Online

Hi,

Last year, almost 50,000 new products were introduced into the market to
satisfy the growing demands of consumers worldwide.

Most of these products were developed by independent product developers,
working on their own, from home offices or small businesses.

Bill Myers has a 15-year track record of creating many successful products,
including books, videos, newsletters, CD-ROMs, software and Internet Web
sites. 

On his all-new three tape set of videos, Bill takes you *behind the scenes*
so you'll learn the EASY way to develop and profit from these kinds of
products yourself, where to find the tools you need to know about, how to
get your first profitable product off the ground . . .  and how to find
customers waiting to buy them.

Watching these tapes is like spending a day working with Bill, learning the
secrets and strategies he uses to generate a very comfortable, low-stress,
high-income lifestyle as an independent product developer. 

Products covered include books, audios and videos, computer software,
workshops, training, Internet specific products, and lots more. 

You'll learn: 

•How the product development business works
•How to find automatic product creation tools 
•How to come up with profitable product ideas 
•How to develop killer product ads 
•The easy-to-create Internet product that is a CUSTOMER MAGNET
•The four most profitable product types 
•The easiest products for you to develop quickly 
•How to find customers for your products 
•The single biggest mistake product developers make 
•How to predict and cash in on emerging trends 
•Plus a whole lot more . . .  including examples of actual products you can
develop in 30 days or less.

This tape set is now shipping and includes a printed resource and reference
guide that helps you take advantage of all the goodies demonstrated in the
videos.
