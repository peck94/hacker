FACT:  Coronary Heart Disease is the #1 Killer of
Americans as reported by the United States Surgeon
General.

FACT:  The United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) recently reported that a steady intake of psyllium
(a natural source of fiber) may play a valuable role in
lowering the risk of coronary heart disease.

FACT:  For over twenty years, at the request of the
British Medical Association, Sir Jason Winters (a
complimentary alternative medicine advocate) has stressed
the importance of psyllium’s effects on the body when used
as a part of your daily diet.  Evidently, his pioneering
research has finally been validated by this recent study!

The FDA Report
------------------------
FDA Proposes Health Claim for Psyllium!

According to the May 22 Federal Register, the FDA proposed
a rule that would amend regulation permitting food
labeling bearing a health claim on soluble fiber from
whole oats and lower risk of coronary heart disease to
include soluble fiber from psyllium husks.  The qualifying
level of psyllium fiber is proposed to be 10.2g per total
daily intake.  This proposal is a result of Kellogg Co.
filing a petition in June 1996 requesting that foods which
contain a certain amount of psyllium to become eligible
for the reduced coronary heart disease risk claim. The
cereal manufacture’s petition contained data from 57
clinical studies on psyllium’s effects  on lowering
cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease dated
from 1965-1996.

Psyllium, a harvestable grain mostly grown in France,
Spain and India, according to Health Daily News, is
cultivated in small amounts in southwestern United States.
 The FDA in not certain whether it will consider psyllium
husk in grain-based food applications as generally
recognized as safe (GRAS), which Kellogg requested.
According to the FDA, "A preliminary review of the GRAS
affirmation petition reveals that it contains significant
evidence supporting the safety of the use of this
substance at the levels necessary to justify a health
claim."  The FDA refers to a report from the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology’s Life
Sciences Research Office determining that psyllium is safe
at levels of up to 25g per day.
