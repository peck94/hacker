To: nphone@hotmail.com

Dear Internet User,

We would like you to try our free software that allows you to call
any phone in the world from personal computer connected to the Internet.
The signal is carried over the Internet until it reaches US-based
phone switches, and the switch instantly and automatically relays the
call to its final destination - any telephone. This technology
dramatically reduces telephone bills by up to 95% off the cost of
traditional long distance calls. Calls to US 800/888 numbers are free
and calls to other US numbers are as little as 10 cents a minute
from anywhere in the world.
Please visit our web page for info and download instructions:

http://n2p.webpagers.net

If you have trouble to download program, please let us know and we'll
send you it by email (please specify your name, email, country, 
type of computer, operation system, and internet connection speed).

Sincerely,

Steve Terry
