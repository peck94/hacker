THIS HAS TO BE THE EASIEST PROGRAM I HAVE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN AND IT WAS A “SPLENDID” SUCCESS!!!

RACE IS NOT AN ISSUE, NEITHER IS YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCE, AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO SPEND MONEY, YOU QUALIFY!

I have seen and heard all of the get rich quick schemes on the Internet. I’ve called the Post Office to see what was legal and what was illegal. I’ve consulted with my Attorney and this one is for real.

The way this works is that you send $5.00 to every person on this list, in exchange the recipient will ad your name to the list, remove one name from the list and E-mail the new list to 100 people, requesting that they do the same. That’s it! No bells no whistles, JUST CASH IN THE MAIL!!!

I started this one just 4 weeks ago, already I have received over $1000.00...it works and it’s legal...so try it if you like, delete it if you don’t, it will be your loss.
You won’t get rich, but believe me you will get some help with your bills. Just do it!!!

Write on a piece of paper “Please put me on your list and send my name to 100 people”!
When you start receiving $5.00 bills in the mail, you must send that person’s  to 100 people,  via e-mail, you must in order to keep this project legal....HAPPY MAILING!

Be sure to wrap the $5.00 in a piece of paper so that it cannot be seen through the envelope, they caught a Postal Worker stealing them once, so make sure no one can see it through the envelope.
