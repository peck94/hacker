STOP PAYING THOSE INFLATED AIRFARE PRICES !!!

On December 29, 1997 USA Today reported that business fares are expected to rise
approximately 20% in 1998. This is on top of a 15% gain from 1997. EXCURSION
OR VACATION FARES CANNOT BE FAR BEHIND !!!

Many people believe that they can find the cheapest airfares by surfing
through the many on-line reservation systems available on the Internet. 
DON'T BE FOOLED !! These reservation systems are owned, operated and 
maintained by the airlines themselves and are often slow to be updated. 
They also don't include many of the deeply discounted fare programs offered
by the airlines. 

How often have you called the Airlines or your local TraveLAgent and 
asked them to give you their cheapest fare, only to find that the person 
sitting next to you has  gotten their seat for much less. "The Insider's Guide
to Cheaper Airfares" will introduce you to other ticketing alternatives and
strategies that the Major Airlines don't want you to know about. These sources
offer deeply discounted seats that are on the same flights that airlines are
charging others twice as much. Among the Things this valuable book will
show you are:

*** How to get the Airlines to notify you about discounts before they go public. 

*** Ticket strategies Airlines don't want you to know. 

*** How to save at least 50% on International Travel. 

*** Which reservation systems work best with which Hubs
        and Airlines,. 

*** How to get domestic tickets for 40% to 60% off.

Whether your goal is to go on that vacation of a lifetime or to bring a loved 
one home to the family, "The Insider's Guide to Cheaper Airfares" will show
you that reasonable airfares from anywhere in the country are easily and
affordably within your reach. 

Why give all of your hard earned money to the airlines when you can spend that 
money on fun once you arrive.
