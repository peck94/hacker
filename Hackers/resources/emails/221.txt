Subject: FREE software to call anywhere over the Internet
To: net2phone@webpagers.net

Dear Internet User,

Would you like to try free software that allows you to call any phone in
the world from personal computer connected to the Internet?
The signal is carried over the Internet until it reaches US-based
phone switches, and the switch instantly and automatically relays the
call to its final destination - any telephone. This technology
dramatically reduces telephone bills by up to 95% off the cost of
traditional long distance calls. Calls to US 800/888 numbers are free
and calls to other US numbers are as little as 10 cents a minute
from anywhere in the world.
Please visit our web page for info and download instructions:

If you have trouble to download program, please let us know and we'll
send you it by email. Requirements: Pentium 100 or higher recommended, 
Win 3.1 or 95, sound card, speakers, microphone, Internet connection 
28.8 or higher. 

Sincerely,

Steve Terry
