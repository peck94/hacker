Dear Internet Friend & Entrepreneur:


I just learned of a company that is the premier and only company to offer Electricity Deregulation and Bundled Services. What are Bundled Services. The 21st century way to offer services. See below. We are not a start up or get rich quick scheme. This is a real opportunity with a public company. Read on.

Imagine Utility Savings(coming soon)! How about discounts on the following services: Cellular  Paging, Long Distance, Local Dial, Internet Service, Web Design and Hosting, Cable/Satellite, Home Security Systems & Monitoring, Internet Commerce and More! Who are our exclusive vendors? One of the top 3 in their respective industries. Our strength and negotiating powers are at work for you. We have contracts in hand!

You've got to check this out!

Now imagine being a marketer of those services and earning a recurring monthly commission on the usage of consumers throughout the country... Services they already use but discounted! No hard selling or products to inventory. No door to door selling. Would you like to market these online? Do you think your customer would like the convenience of one bill and go on line to check their usage and add more services? How can we do it? We are the internet.
